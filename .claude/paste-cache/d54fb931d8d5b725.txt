Role: You are a Senior Creative Developer and UI/UX Designer specializing in "Awwwards-winning" web experiences.

Objective: Create a high-fidelity, energetic Landing Page for a Badminton App called "RallyCoach".

Visual Style: - Theme: "Dark Mode Cyber-Sport". Use a deep void black/navy background with dynamic neon glow effects (Gradient blobs of Neon Blue #3B82F6 and Rally Red #EF4444).

Brand Identity: Incorporate "Yonex-style" accents (Deep Blue & Vibrant Green) for primary actions to maintain professional sporting credibility.

Typography: Bold, Italicized, Sans-Serif fonts (like 'Inter' or 'Roboto') that look like they are in motion.

Key Feature Implementation (The Hero Section):
I need a specific "2.5D Layered Composition" for the Hero image to show depth. Please implement the following structure:

Atmosphere: A background layer with animated, pulsing gradient blobs to create a "stadium atmosphere."

Background Layer: A container displaying a "Team Lineup" image. Apply a CSS mask or gradient fade at the bottom so it blends into the page.

Foreground Layer (The "Pop-Out"): A transparent PNG of a single player performing a jump smash.

Constraint: Position this player absolutely on top of the Background Layer.

The Trick: Use a negative top margin (e.g., -top-10) and a high z-index so the player's head and racket visually "break out" of the underlying container's bounding box.

Interaction: Add a "Parallax" or "Float" animation to the Foreground player so they gently move independently of the background, enhancing the 3D effect.

Animation Requirements:

Create a reusable <RevealOnScroll> React component using IntersectionObserver.

Behavior: Elements should start at opacity-0 and translate-y-20. When scrolled into view, they should transition smoothly (duration-700ms) to opacity-100 and translate-y-0.

Apply this animation to the text, the buttons, and sequentially to the player images ("staggered" entrance).

Tech Stack: React (Single File), Tailwind CSS, Lucide-React icons.
