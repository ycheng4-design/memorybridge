The “GrowthOps Agent” Product You’ll Build (real, implementable)
What it does end-to-end
A) 小红书运营：选题 → 脚本 → 发布 → 数据复盘 → DM建联
B) LinkedIn 冷启动：内容运营 + cold outreach（投/创两端）
C) 做名单、写话术、A/B测试，提高回复率和转化
D) auto coding email、分类、找 potential founder（合规）
1) Platform Reality Check (don’t skip)
LinkedIn: No automation on the website

LinkedIn explicitly prohibits third-party software/bots/extensions that scrape or automate activity on LinkedIn’s website.
So your system should:

NOT auto-DM, auto-connect, auto-comment via browser bots.

YES: generate drafts, queue tasks, remind you, log outcomes, A/B test copy, enrich leads off-platform.

LinkedIn API: possible but limited + rate-limited

If you have approved access (often hard), API calls are rate limited and controlled.
Pragmatically: plan for manual LinkedIn execution + automation around it.

小红书 (RED): treat as “manual publish + automated prep + automated reporting”

Small red book policies + ecosystem are less open than email. Also, privacy/security research indicates the app has had serious network/privacy concerns—don’t pipe sensitive data into it, and don’t build brittle scraping bots.
So: agent helps you win at planning + writing + analysis, not “hacky auto-posting.”

2) System Architecture (the actual product)
Core stack (minimal, real)

Database / CRM (system-of-record): Airtable (fast) or Postgres (later).

Worker + scheduler: Node.js (BullMQ/Redis) or Python (Celery/Redis).

LLM layer: structured prompts + JSON outputs + evaluation checks.

Email sending (real deliverability): SendGrid / Postmark / Amazon SES (choose one).

Analytics: Metabase / Looker Studio + event table.

Human-in-loop UI: a simple web dashboard (Next.js) showing queues + drafts + “Copy” buttons.

3) The Agent Modules (each bulletpoint, taken seriously)
Module A — 小红书选题（Topic Engine）

Inputs

Your ICP (e.g., US early-stage founders, AI tools, B2B SaaS)

Your product proof points (pitch video, investor exposure, outcomes)

Weekly content goals (e.g., 5 posts/week)

Process

Trend + audience mining (manual-safe)

You (human) paste 20–50 links/screenshots of competitor notes + comments once/day.

Agent extracts themes: pain points, phrases, formats that perform.

Topic scoring

Score each topic by:

ICP match

novelty

call-to-action suitability (“founders try this”)

production effort

Outputs a weekly content slate: 10 topics, 5 chosen, each with hook + outline.

Output example

Topic: “Founder pitch video template that investors actually watch”

Hook options: 5

Outline: 6 beats

CTA: “Reply ‘template’ / DM for invite”

Module B — 小红书脚本（Script + creative spec）

Produces:

15–30s / 45–60s scripts

shot list (B-roll, on-screen text)

caption + hashtags

DM follow-up line (when someone comments/likes)

Quality gates (automatic)

“No vague claims” check

“Clear CTA” check

“Feels native” check (short lines, punchy, not corporate)

Module C — 发布（Posting workflow, real-world）

Reality: you likely post manually to avoid brittle automation.

Agent creates “Ready-to-post pack”:

caption

hashtags

cover text

first comment

posting checklist

Dashboard shows: Post Now (copy buttons) + schedule reminders.

Module D — 数据复盘（Analytics recap）

Realistic method (no scraping bots)

You export/record platform analytics (screenshots or CSV if available).

Agent parses and stores metrics:

impressions, saves, shares, comments, profile visits

DM started, DM replies

Weekly report:

top 3 winners (why)

3 losers (why)

next week experiments

Module E — DM建联（DM assistant, not DM bot）

Agent drafts:

opener (contextual)

1–2 follow-ups

“soft CTA” (invite to try product)

Human sends manually in XHS.

4) LinkedIn 冷启动 Plan (compliance-safe)
Non-negotiable: manual LinkedIn actions

Because LinkedIn disallows third-party automation/scraping on the site.

What you do automate
A) LinkedIn content ops (draft → review → post)

Agent generates 3 posts/week:

Founder value post

Build-in-public progress

Case study / insight

Each post has:

3 hook variants

1 short version + 1 long version

comment bait (question)

You paste into LinkedIn and post manually (or via LinkedIn’s own scheduler).

B) Cold outreach (投/创两端) — “Queue + Draft + Log”

Founder lane

connection note draft (<= 250–300 chars style)

DM 1, DM 2 follow-up, breakup message

objection replies (busy, not now, who are you, send link, etc.)

Investor lane

short intro + ask to review weekly digest

“opt-in” flow (to avoid spam vibes)

Human workflow

Each day: 30–60 mins

Agent shows 20 profiles to contact (you sourced ethically)

You click send manually

Log outcomes automatically by your input (one-click: positive/neutral/negative)

5) Lead List Building + Classification (真实 “做名单”)
Allowed sources (real, scalable, low risk)

Conference attendee lists you legitimately obtained

Founder communities you are a member of

Public startup directories where terms allow it (you still must follow site rules)

Referrals (highest conversion)

Lead enrichment (safe)

Company site → identify founder name + role

Press/about pages

Contact email patterns only when legally/ethically OK

Classification (自动分类)

Agent labels leads by:

stage (idea/MVP/seed)

vertical (AI/devtools/consumer)

geography/timezone

“activation likelihood” score (based on fit signals)

6) Email Automation (the one channel you can truly automate)
Deliverability foundations (must be real)

Domain setup: SPF + DKIM + DMARC

Dedicated sending subdomain (e.g., mail.yourdomain.com)

Unsubscribe + physical address + honest identity

The Email Agent (auto coding email)

What it does

Generates personalized email variants (A/B)

Sends via SES/SendGrid/Postmark (real)

Tracks opens/clicks/replies (where supported)

Auto-schedules follow-ups

Stops on reply/opt-out/bounce

A/B test examples

A: “Quick question about your pitch video”

B: “Can we feature your startup to investors this week?”

Conversion events

Reply

Call booked

Registration completed

Pitch video uploaded (primary)

7) Calls / Voicemail /留言 (realistic + safe)

You can integrate Twilio, but don’t build robocall spam. Keep it human-led:

Agent prepares call scripts + objection handling

Agent creates call task list (who to call today)

You (human) calls; after call you select outcome

Optional: voicemail drop only if allowed in your region + consent rules (ask your manager/legal)

8) Execution Plan (4 weeks to a working v1)
Week 1 — Foundations

Airtable base + statuses + pipeline

Email domain authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)

Draft UI: “Content queue” + “Outreach queue”

Agent v0: topic generator + email draft generator

Week 2 — Email engine + A/B

Integrate SendGrid/SES/Postmark

Variant tracking + reply logging

Follow-up scheduler (stop rules)

Start sending low volume (warmup)

Week 3 — XHS workflow + analytics recap

“Ready-to-post pack” generator

Manual posting checklist + schedule reminders

Weekly metrics ingestion (screenshots/exports) → recap report

Week 4 — LinkedIn copilot + lead scoring

Outreach queue UI (manual send)

Message library + personalization snippets

Lead scoring model v1 (rule-based)

Weekly experiment report (reply rate + activation rate)

9) Guardrails (so your agent doesn’t become a liability)

Open agentic tools can create real security risk if you give them broad access; keep permissions narrow and auditable.
Concrete guardrails:

No direct access to LinkedIn/XHS accounts via bots.

Secrets in vault (never in prompts).

Allowlist actions (send email, create draft, schedule task).

Human approval required for: sending >N emails/day, any “export data” step, any phone action.

10) What your job becomes (daily operating loop)

Daily (60–120 min)

Review content drafts → post manually (XHS/LinkedIn)

Send 20–40 manual LinkedIn actions (safe pacing)

Approve email batch + review replies

Weekly (90 min)

Run experiment review: which scripts/messages converted

Update ICP rules + scoring

Build next week’s topic slate
