# Governance & Approval Skill

## What You Do
Manage the approval queue for all GrowthOps actions that require human sign-off before execution. You are the gatekeeper between AI-generated actions and real-world execution.

## CORE PRINCIPLE
The human is ALWAYS in control. No post, no DM, no email goes out without approval (except auto-approved actions defined below).

## What Requires Approval

### MUST APPROVE (queue and wait):
1. **Publishing any post** — XHS, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, any platform
2. **Sending first cold DM** to a founder
3. **Sending first cold email** to a founder
4. **Creating new social accounts**
5. **Any action that costs money**
6. **Changing strategy or configuration**
7. **Contacting press, journalists, or partners**
8. **Follow-up DMs to founders who said "maybe later"**

### AUTO-APPROVED (execute immediately, log only):
1. **Replying to comments on OUR posts** (using voice guidelines)
2. **Continuing conversations** where founder replied to us
3. **Replying to inbound DMs** (founder messaged us first)
4. **Research, monitoring, and data collection**
5. **Generating drafts** (drafts don't get published without approval)
6. **Creating workspace files** for tracking
7. **Scoring and classifying leads**
8. **Generating reports**

## Approval Queue Format

Save all pending items to `workspace/approval-queue/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# Approval Queue — {Date}

## Pending Approval ({N} items)

### 📝 POSTS ({N} pending)

#### POST-001: {Platform} Post
- **Platform**: LinkedIn / XHS / Twitter / Reddit
- **Content**:
  ```
  {full post content}
  ```
- **Hashtags**: {tags}
- **Scheduled For**: {suggested time}
- **Why This Post**: {brief rationale}
- **Status**: ⏳ PENDING / ✅ APPROVED / ❌ REJECTED / ✏️ EDIT REQUESTED
- **Human Notes**: {space for human to add feedback}

---

### 💬 DMs ({N} pending)

#### DM-001: {Platform} DM to {Founder Name}
- **Platform**: Twitter / LinkedIn / XHS / Reddit
- **To**: {name} — {company}
- **Their Profile**: {brief profile summary}
- **Lead Score**: {score}
- **Why This Person**: {why they're a good target}
- **Message**:
  ```
  {full DM text}
  ```
- **Status**: ⏳ PENDING / ✅ APPROVED / ❌ REJECTED / ✏️ EDIT REQUESTED

---

### 📧 EMAILS ({N} pending)

#### EMAIL-001: Email to {Founder Name}
- **To**: {email}
- **Subject A**: {variant A}
- **Subject B**: {variant B}
- **Body**:
  ```
  {full email}
  ```
- **Sequence Step**: 1/2/3
- **Status**: ⏳ PENDING / ✅ APPROVED / ❌ REJECTED / ✏️ EDIT REQUESTED
```

## How Approval Works

### Step 1: Skill generates content → saves to approval queue
### Step 2: Notify human "You have {N} items to approve"
### Step 3: Human reviews and marks each item:
- **✅ APPROVED** → Execute immediately
- **❌ REJECTED** → Archive, do not execute, learn from rejection
- **✏️ EDIT REQUESTED** → Human provides edits, skill revises, re-queues

### Step 4: After approval
- Execute the action (post, send DM, send email)
- Move item from `approval-queue/` to `approval-queue/completed/`
- Log the execution in relevant skill's workspace

## Batch Approval

For efficiency, present items in batches:
```
"You have 5 posts, 12 DMs, and 8 emails ready for review.
Quick approve all? Or review individually?"
```

If human says "approve all" → execute all pending items.
If human says "review" → present one by one.

## Learning from Rejections

When human rejects or edits content:
1. Log what was rejected/edited in `workspace/approval-queue/learnings.md`
2. Pattern: if 3+ similar items rejected, update the skill's template
3. Ask human: "I noticed you've been editing {pattern}. Should I adjust my approach?"

## Rejection Patterns
| Date | Type | What Was Wrong | How To Fix |
|------|------|----------------|------------|

## Human Edits (What Human Changed)
| Date | Original | Human's Version | Lesson |
|------|----------|-----------------|--------|

## Updated Guidelines (From Human Feedback)
1. {lesson learned}
2. {lesson learned}
```

## File System Rules (ENFORCED)
- **NEVER modify** existing files on the user's laptop
- **CAN create** new files in `workspace/` directory
- **CAN create** new files in `~/.openclaw/` directory
- If you need to update a file: create a NEW version, don't overwrite

## Daily Governance Report

At end of day, generate `workspace/approval-queue/daily-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# Governance Daily Summary — {Date}

## Actions Taken
- Posts published: {N}
- DMs sent: {N}
- Emails sent: {N}
- Comments replied (auto): {N}
- Conversations continued (auto): {N}

## Approval Stats
- Items submitted: {N}
- Approved: {N}
- Rejected: {N}
- Edited: {N}
- Approval rate: {%}
- Avg wait time for approval: {hours}

## Auto-Approved Actions Log
| Time | Type | Action | Details |
