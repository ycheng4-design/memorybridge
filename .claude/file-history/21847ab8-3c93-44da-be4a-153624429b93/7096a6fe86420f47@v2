# A/B Testing Skill

## What You Do
Design, run, and analyze A/B tests across email subjects, outreach messages, LinkedIn posts, and XHS content. Track results, declare winners with statistical confidence, and auto-promote winning variants.

## Test Types

### Email Subject Lines
- Create 2 variants per campaign
- Split 50/50 across recipients
- Track: open rate, reply rate, click rate
- Declare winner after 100 sends per variant (or 50 if clear signal)

### Outreach Messages
- Test connection request copy (LinkedIn drafts)
- Test DM opening lines
- Track: acceptance rate, reply rate, positive reply rate

### Content Hooks
- Test 2 hook variants per XHS/LinkedIn post
- Measure: engagement rate (likes + comments + saves / views)

## Running a Test

### 1. Create Test
Save to `workspace/ab-tests/active/{test-id}.md`:

```markdown
# A/B Test: {test-id}
- **Type**: email-subject / outreach-message / content-hook
- **Hypothesis**: {what you expect}
- **Start Date**: {date}
- **Target Sample**: {N per variant}

## Variant A (Control)
{content}

## Variant B (Challenger)
{content}

## Results
| Metric | Variant A | Variant B |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Sent/Shown | 0 | 0 |
| Opens/Views | 0 | 0 |
| Clicks/Engagement | 0 | 0 |
| Replies/Conversions | 0 | 0 |
| Rate | 0% | 0% |

## Status: RUNNING / WINNER_A / WINNER_B / NO_DIFFERENCE
```

### 2. Update Results
After each batch send or content post, update the results table.

### 3. Declare Winner
- Minimum sample: 50 per variant (100 preferred)
- Winner needs ≥20% relative improvement
- If <20% difference after 200 total sends: declare NO_DIFFERENCE, pick simpler variant
- Move completed test to `workspace/ab-tests/completed/`

### 4. Apply Winner
- Email: update template in email-engine skill
- Outreach: update template in linkedin-ops or dm-outreach skill
- Content: use winning hook pattern for future content

## Test Ideas Queue

Maintain `workspace/ab-tests/ideas.md` with upcoming tests:
```
1. Subject: Question vs Statement format
2. CTA: "Upload now" vs "See examples first"
3. Social proof: Specific number vs Vague ("many founders")
4. Personalization: Company name in subject vs Not
5. Length: Short (2 sentences) vs Medium (4 sentences)
```

## Reporting
- Weekly: summarize all active tests and recent winners
- Include in weekly report skill output
