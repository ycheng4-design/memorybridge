## Platform Format Rules

- Last tweet: CTA + link
- Add "🧵" to first tweet

### Reddit Post

- Lead with value/insight
- Mention PitchTok naturally in context
- Follow subreddit rules strictly

### Email Snippet
- Subject line variant
- 2-3 paragraph extract
- Clear CTA button text

### 知乎 Answer
- Find existing question that matches topic
- Answer format: problem → insight → solution → subtle mention
- 800-1500 characters
- No hard selling

### Blog Post
- SEO-friendly title
- H2/H3 structure
- 800-1200 words
- Include internal links
- Meta description

## Output Format

Save to `workspace/repurposed/YYYY-MM-DD-{source-slug}/`:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-{source-slug}/
├── source.md          # Original content
├── twitter-thread.md
├── xhs-post.md
├── linkedin-post.md
├── reddit-post.md
├── email-snippet.md
├── blog-outline.md
└── index.md           # Links to all versions + posting schedule
```

## Scheduling
- Stagger posts across platforms (don't post everywhere same day)
- Day 1: Primary platform (where original was posted)
- Day 2: Twitter/X + 即刻
- Day 3: LinkedIn + Reddit
- Day 4: 小红书 (if translated)
- Day 5: Blog + email newsletter

## Quality Rules
- Each version must feel native to its platform
- Never copy-paste across platforms (algorithms penalize)
- Adapt, don't just translate
- Each version should be at least 40% different from original
- Preserve core message and CTA across all versions
