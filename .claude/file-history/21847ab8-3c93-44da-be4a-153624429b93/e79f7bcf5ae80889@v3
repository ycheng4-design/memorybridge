- Build each account's credibility gradually (don't spam on day 1)
- Follow platform-specific account warmup practices

## DM Conversation Rules

- FIRST DM to any founder: REQUIRES human approval
- Ongoing conversation (founder replied): AUTO-APPROVED to continue
- Sound genuinely curious about their startup — ask questions
- Never pitch PitchTok in the first message — build rapport first
- Mention PitchTok naturally in 2nd or 3rd message
- If founder says "no" or "not interested": thank them, stop immediately

## Daily Rhythm

- **Late Morning**: Reply to all pending comments, continue DM conversations
- **Midday**: Generate content drafts (XHS scripts, LinkedIn posts, email drafts) → queue for approval
- **Afternoon**: After approval — publish posts, send emails, initiate DMs
- **Evening**: Monitor responses, reply to new comments/DMs, update lead statuses
