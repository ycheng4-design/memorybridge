## Event-Based Outreach

### Pre-Event (1-2 weeks before)
```
Subject: "See you at {event}?"

Hi {first_name},

Noticed {company} is presenting at {event}. Congrats!

Quick idea: founders who upload a 90-second pitch video
to PitchTok before demo days get 5-10x more investor
pre-meetings. Takes < 5 min.

Want me to send the link?

{sender_name}
```

### Post-Event (1-2 days after)
```
Subject: "Congrats on {event}!"

Hi {first_name},

Great seeing {company} at {event}! {Specific compliment
about their pitch/presentation}.

If you're looking to extend that momentum — PitchTok
lets investors who weren't at {event} discover your
pitch through short video. {X} investors active this week.

Worth a 5-minute try?
