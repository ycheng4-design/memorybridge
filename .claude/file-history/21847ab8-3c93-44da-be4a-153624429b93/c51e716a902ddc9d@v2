# DM Outreach Skill

## What You Do
Generate personalized DM drafts for multiple platforms. Human copies and sends manually. Track responses and optimize templates.

## CRITICAL RULES
- **NEVER automate DM sending** on platforms that prohibit it (Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Slack communities)
- Generate drafts only — human sends manually
- Respect platform rate limits and community rules
- Never spam — personalize every message

## Platform Templates

### Twitter/X DM
```
Hey {first_name} — saw your tweet about {topic}. We built
PitchTok where founders record 90-sec pitch videos and
investors discover them (like TikTok for deal flow).

{X} {vertical} founders got investor intros last week.
Would you be open to trying it? Takes < 5 min.
```

### Reddit DM
```
Hi {username} — saw your post in r/{subreddit} about {topic}.
Really cool what you're building with {company}.

Quick question: have you tried video pitching? We're seeing
founders get 3-5x more investor attention with 90-second
pitch clips vs cold emails/decks. Happy to share what's
working in {vertical} if interested.

No pressure either way — rooting for you!
```

### Product Hunt Comment + DM
```
Comment (public): "Love the concept! The {specific_feature}
is really clever. Curious how you're approaching {relevant_topic}?"

DM (after engagement): "Hey {name} — congrats on the launch!
Since you're clearly getting traction, have you thought about
fundraising? We have {X} investors on PitchTok actively
looking at {vertical} startups this week."
```

### Discord/Slack Community
```
Hey {name}! Saw your intro in #{channel}. {company} sounds
really interesting — especially the {specific_detail}.

We're building PitchTok (short video pitches for investors)
and seeing some cool traction with {vertical} founders.
Would love to connect if you're open to it.
```

### Indie Hackers
```
Hey {name} — congrats on {milestone} with {product}!
Really impressive growth.

Quick thought: if you're thinking about raising, we've
been seeing founders get way more investor attention with
90-second pitch videos vs traditional decks. Happy to
share what's working if you're curious.
```

## Outreach Queue

Save daily queue to `workspace/dm-outreach/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# DM Outreach Queue — {Date}

## Twitter/X (max 10 DMs/day)
### 1. @{handle} — {Company}
- Context: {why they're a fit}
- Draft: "{personalized message}"
- Status: [ ] Sent / [ ] Replied

## Reddit (max 5 DMs/day)
### 1. u/{username} — {Company}
- Post: {link to their post}
- Draft: "{personalized message}"
- Status: [ ] Sent / [ ] Replied

## Product Hunt (max 5/day)
### 1. {Maker Name} — {Product}
- Launch: {link}
- Comment draft: "{comment}"
- DM draft: "{dm}"
- Status: [ ] Commented / [ ] DM Sent / [ ] Replied

## Discord/Slack (max 5/day)
### 1. {Name} — {Community}
- Channel: #{channel}
- Draft: "{message}"
- Status: [ ] Sent / [ ] Replied
```

## Personalization Rules
1. Always reference something specific (their post, product, tweet)
2. Never use generic openers ("Hope you're doing well")
3. Keep under 150 words
4. One clear CTA per message
5. Sound human, not like a template
6. Match the platform's tone (casual on Reddit, professional on LinkedIn)

## Response Handling
When someone replies positively:
- Move to HOT lead tier
- Send PitchTok signup link
- Follow up in 2 days if no signup

When someone replies negatively:
- Add to suppression list for that platform
- Thank them, do not argue
- Never contact again on that platform

## Daily Limits

| Twitter/X | 10 | 20 |
| Reddit | 5 | 10 |
