# Founder Finder Skill

## What You Do
Search the internet to find early-stage US-based startup founders for PitchTok.

## Sources (Search in this priority order)

### 1. Product Hunt (Highest Quality)
- Open browser → go to producthunt.com
- Browse today's launches and recent launches (last 7 days)
- Look for makers with US-based products
- Extract: founder name, company, product URL, maker profile
- Focus on products with 50-500 upvotes (hungry for funding but showing traction)

### 2. Apollo.io API (Highest Volume)
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.apollo.io/v1/mixed_people/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $APOLLO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "q_person_title": ["founder", "co-founder", "ceo"],
    "person_locations": ["United States"],
    "q_organization_num_employees_ranges": ["1,10"],
    "q_organization_industry_tag_ids": ["5567cd4c7369647775790000"],
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 25
  }'
```

### 3. Hacker News
- Browse news.ycombinator.com
- Search for "Show HN" and "Launch HN" posts from last 7 days
- Extract founder usernames → check profiles for email/website

### 4. GitHub Trending
- Browse github.com/trending
- Look for repos that appear to be products (not libraries)
- Check repo owner's profile for "founder", "CEO", "building"
- Cross-reference with company website

### 5. Indie Hackers
- Browse indiehackers.com/products
- Filter by recently launched, revenue-sharing founders
- Extract founder name, product, contact info

### 6. Twitter/X
- Search for: #buildinpublic, #startup, "just launched", "we're raising"
- Filter by US-based accounts
- Extract profiles of founders tweeting about their startups

### 7. Reddit
- Browse r/startups, r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur
- Look for posts tagged "Feedback", "Launch", "Show r/startups"
- Extract OP's product and contact info

### 8. BetaList
- Browse betalist.com for recently listed startups
- Extract founder and company info

### 9. Crunchbase
- Search for recently funded pre-seed/seed companies
- Filter: US, founded 2024-2026, raised < $2M

## Output Format

For each founder found, save to `workspace/leads/YYYY-MM-DD-new-leads.md`:

```markdown
## Lead: {Founder Name}
- **Company**: {company name}
- **Email**: {email if found}
- **LinkedIn**: {linkedin URL}
- **Source**: {where you found them}
- **Stage**: {idea/mvp/seed}
- **Vertical**: {AI/SaaS/etc}

- **Score**: {0-100, use scoring rules from lead-scorer skill}
- **Notes**: {why they're a good fit}
- **Found**: {date}

```

## Volume Target
- Find 20-50 new founders per run
- Prioritize quality over quantity
- De-duplicate against existing leads in workspace/leads/

## Important
- Only collect publicly available information
- Do not scrape LinkedIn profiles (use Apollo.io for LinkedIn data)
- Respect robots.txt on all sites
- If Apollo API key is not set, skip Apollo and use browser-based sources only
