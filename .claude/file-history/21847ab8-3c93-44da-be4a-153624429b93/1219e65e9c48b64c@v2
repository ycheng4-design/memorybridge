# Referral Engine Skill

## What You Do
Design referral programs, generate referral ask messages, track referral chains, and identify top referrers. Drive organic founder-to-founder growth.

## Referral Programs

### Program 1: Founder Referral
- **Trigger**: After a founder uploads a video
- **Ask**: "Know another founder raising? Share PitchTok and both get priority investor visibility."
- **Incentive**: Featured placement in investor feed for 1 week
- **Tracking**: Unique referral link per founder

### Program 2: Investor Referral
- **Trigger**: After an investor watches 5+ pitches
- **Ask**: "Know a founder who should be on PitchTok?"
- **Incentive**: Early access to new pitches in their preferred verticals
- **Tracking**: Investor referral code

### Program 3: Community Ambassador
- **Trigger**: Founders who actively promote PitchTok
- **Perks**: Direct intro to top investors, featured founder spotlight
- **Requirements**: Refer 5+ founders who upload videos

## Referral Ask Messages

### Post-Upload Email (Automated via email-engine)
```
Subject: "Your pitch is live! One more thing..."

Hey {first_name},

Your PitchTok video is live and investors are already
browsing! 🎉

Quick ask: know another founder who's raising?
Share your referral link and you both get priority
visibility in the investor feed for a week.

Your link: {referral_link}

Just forward this email or share the link.

{sender_name}
```

### In-App Prompt (Copy for Product Team)
```
"Your pitch video got {X} investor views!
Share PitchTok with a founder friend →
Both get 1 week of priority placement."
[Share Link] [Copy Link] [Maybe Later]
```

### DM Ask (After Positive Reply)
```
Btw — if you know any other founders raising,
feel free to share PitchTok with them. We give
both of you priority investor visibility when
someone joins through your link.

Your link: {referral_link}
```

## Referral Tracking

## Viral Loop Design

```
Founder uploads video
    → Gets investor views
    → Gets excited, shares with founder friends
    → Friends upload videos
    → More videos attract more investors
    → More investors attract more founders
    → Repeat
```

## Referral Content Templates

### Social Share (For Founders to Post)
```
Just uploaded my 90-sec pitch to @PitchTok and already
got {X} investor views. Way better than cold emailing
pitch decks. If you're raising, check it out:
{referral_link}
```

### Email Forward Template
```
Hey — thought you'd be interested in this. I uploaded
a short pitch video and investors are actually watching.
Way easier than cold outreach. Here's my link:
{referral_link}
```

## Identifying Potential Referrers
Look for founders who:
- Reply positively to outreach
- Upload a video within 24 hours
- Have large social following (can amplify)
- Are in active founder communities
- Have previously referred other products

Flag these in lead records with `referral_potential: high`
