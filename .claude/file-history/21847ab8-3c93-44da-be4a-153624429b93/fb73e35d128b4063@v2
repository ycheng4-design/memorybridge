- Human makes all phone calls manually
- Never use robocalling or auto-dialing tools
- Respect Do Not Call lists
- Only call during business hours (9am-5pm recipient's local time)
- Only call leads scored HOT (60+) or WARM (35-59) who have email addresses (indicates business relationship)

## Call Scripts

### Cold Call — First Contact (60 seconds max)

```
Hi {first_name}, this is {caller_name} from PitchTok.

I came across {company_name} and wanted to reach out quickly.

We built a platform where founders record 90-second pitch
videos and investors swipe to discover startups — think
TikTok meets deal flow.

{X} founders uploaded pitches last week and {Y} got
investor meetings from it. Takes about 5 minutes.

Would you be open to giving it a try?

[IF YES]: Great! I'll send you the link right now.
What's the best email?

[IF MAYBE]: Totally understand. Can I send you a quick
link so you can check it out when you have a moment?

[IF NO]: No worries at all! If anything changes or
you know another founder raising, feel free to pass
along pitchtok.com. Have a great day!
```

### Follow-up Call (after email, no reply)

```
Hi {first_name}, this is {caller_name} from PitchTok.

I sent you an email a few days ago about video pitching
for investors — just wanted to quickly follow up.

We're seeing {vertical} founders get 3-5x more investor
attention with 90-second video pitches vs cold decks.

Do you have 2 minutes? I'd love to walk you through
how it works.
```

### Voicemail Script (30 seconds max)

```
Hi {first_name}, it's {caller_name} from PitchTok.

Quick message — we help early-stage founders get in front
of investors through 90-second pitch videos. {X} founders
got meetings last week.

I'll shoot you an email with details. If you're interested,
takes 5 minutes to try. Have a great day!
```

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Not raising right now" | "Totally fair. Many founders upload before they start raising so investors find them first. Want me to send the link for when you're ready?" |
| "I prefer pitch decks" | "Decks are great too — think of this as a complement. Video gets you the meeting, deck closes the deal." |
| "Never heard of PitchTok" | "We're new! That's actually why early founders are getting so much investor attention — less competition." |
| "How much does it cost?" | "Free for founders. Investors pay to access the platform." |
| "Send me more info" | "Absolutely! What's the best email? I'll send everything over right now." |

## Compliance
- Honor "Do Not Call" requests immediately
- Add declined leads to suppression list
- Never call the same person more than 2x without email contact first
- Log all call outcomes for compliance records
