# Content Learner Skill

## What You Do
Learn content creation techniques from the user and an experienced vlogger. Store lessons permanently. Apply learnings to ALL future content generated by other skills (XHS, LinkedIn, Twitter, SEO, etc.).

## How Learning Works

### When User Teaches You
The user or vlogger will share tips like:
- "This hook style works better: [example]"
- "Use this editing technique: [description]"
- "The vlogger said we should always [advice]"
- "This post format gets more views: [format]"
- "Never do [thing] in videos"
- "这种封面更吸引人"

### What You Do With Each Lesson
1. **Extract the core principle** (what to do, what not to do)
2. **Categorize it** (hook, structure, visual, CTA, platform-specific, etc.)
3. **Save it permanently** to `workspace/content-learnings/LESSONS.md`
4. **Immediately apply** to next content generation
5. **Confirm back**: "Got it! I'll [apply lesson] in all future [content type]. Want me to regenerate any recent content with this new approach?"

## Lesson Storage

Save to `workspace/content-learnings/LESSONS.md`:

```markdown
# Content Creation Lessons

## From Vlogger
### Hooks
1. [{date}] {lesson description} — Source: vlogger
2. [{date}] {lesson}

### Video Structure
1. [{date}] {lesson}

### Visual/Editing
1. [{date}] {lesson}

### Cover Images
1. [{date}] {lesson}

### Captions
1. [{date}] {lesson}

### CTAs
1. [{date}] {lesson}

### What NOT to Do
1. [{date}] {lesson}

## From User (Human)
### Preferences
1. [{date}] {preference}

### Corrections
1. [{date}] User corrected: "{before}" → "{after}"

### Platform-Specific
1. [{date}] {platform}: {lesson}

## From Data (Self-Learned)
### High-Performing Patterns
1. [{date}] Posts with {pattern} get {X}% more engagement

### Low-Performing Patterns
1. [{date}] Posts with {pattern} underperform by {X}%
```

## Applying Lessons to Content Generation

Before generating ANY content (posts, scripts, captions), the content-generating skill MUST:

1. Read `workspace/content-learnings/LESSONS.md`
2. Apply ALL relevant lessons to the content being created
3. If a lesson contradicts a default template → lesson overrides template
4. Note which lessons were applied in the content metadata

### Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | How Lessons Apply |
|-------|-------------------|
| growthops-xhs-content | Apply hook lessons, cover image tips, caption structure |
| growthops-linkedin-ops | Apply hook lessons, post structure, engagement tactics |
| growthops-content-repurposer | Apply platform adaptation lessons |
| growthops-visibility-booster | Apply algorithm optimization lessons |
| growthops-seo-content | Apply writing style lessons |
| growthops-translator | Apply localization lessons |

## Self-Learning from Performance Data

Automatically learn from content performance:
1. Track which posts perform best (views, engagement, conversions)
2. Identify patterns in top performers
3. Generate hypotheses ("posts with numbers in hooks get 2x more views")
4. Test hypotheses with A/B tests
5. If confirmed → add to LESSONS.md as "Self-Learned"

Save analysis to `workspace/content-learnings/performance-analysis.md`:
```markdown
# Content Performance Analysis

## Top 10 Posts (All Time)
| Rank | Platform | Post | Views | Engagement | Key Elements |
|------|----------|------|-------|------------|-------------|

## Pattern Analysis
### What Works (Confirmed)
1. {pattern} — seen in {N} of top 10 posts

### What Doesn't Work (Confirmed)
1. {pattern} — correlates with low performance

### Hypotheses to Test
1. {hypothesis} — test with next {N} posts
```

## Teaching Mode

When the user says "teach mode" or "学习模式":
1. Enter interactive learning session
2. User shows examples of good/bad content
3. For each example, ask: "What makes this work/not work?"
4. Extract lessons from user's explanations
5. Save all lessons
6. At end of session: summarize what was learned
7. Offer to regenerate recent content applying new lessons

## Lesson Revision

If a lesson is contradicted by later data or teaching:
- Don't delete old lesson — mark it as "superseded"
- Add new lesson with reference to old one
- Notify user: "Previously you taught me X, but now Y seems better. Should I update?"
