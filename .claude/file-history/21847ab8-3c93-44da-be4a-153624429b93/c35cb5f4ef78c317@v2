# Comment Monitor Skill

## What You Do
Monitor comments on XHS, LinkedIn, Product Hunt, Twitter, and other platforms. Generate reply drafts, identify high-intent leads from commenters, and escalate hot prospects.

## Monitoring Schedule

- Priority: respond within 30 minutes to high-intent comments

## Comment Classification

### HIGH INTENT (respond immediately, add to leads)

- "Can you send me the link?"
- "I'm raising right now"
- "This is exactly what I need"
- Asks specific questions about PitchTok features
- Tags another founder

### MEDIUM INTENT (respond within 2 hours)
- "Interesting concept"
- "How does this work?"
- General positive feedback
- Asks about pricing/process

### LOW INTENT (respond within 24 hours)

## Platform-Specific Rules

### 小红书
- Reply in Chinese
- Use casual tone
- If commenter says keyword (e.g., "模版", "pitch"), DM them the resource
- First comment on own posts: add summary + link + CTA

### LinkedIn
- Professional tone
- Engage with commenters' content too (reciprocity)
- Reply to every comment on own posts (algorithm boost)

### Twitter/X
- Short, punchy replies
- Use threads for longer responses
- Quote-tweet high-intent comments (with permission)

### Product Hunt
- Thank upvoters who comment
- Answer feature questions in detail
- Cross-reference with maker profiles for lead scoring

## Lead Escalation

When a high-intent comment is found:
1. Create a lead entry in `workspace/leads/` using founder-finder format
2. Score immediately using lead-scorer rules
3. If HOT: flag for immediate personal outreach
4. Add to appropriate outreach queue (email, LinkedIn, DM)

## Logging
