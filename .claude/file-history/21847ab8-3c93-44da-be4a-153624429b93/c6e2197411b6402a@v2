# Email Engine Skill

## What You Do
Send personalized, compliant cold emails to founders via SendGrid API. Manage sequences, A/B tests, follow-ups, and suppression lists.

## Before Every Send — MANDATORY Checks
1. Check `workspace/email/suppression-list.md` — NEVER email anyone on this list
2. Check `workspace/email/warmup-tracker.md` — respect daily sending limit
3. Verify email has: unsubscribe link, physical address, honest subject line

## Email Templates

### Sequence A: Direct Pitch (3 emails)

**Email 1 (Day 0)**
```
Subject A: "Quick question about {company_name}"
Subject B: "{first_name}, 60-sec pitch video = investor intros this week?"

Hi {first_name},

I came across {company_name} on {source} — {specific_compliment}.

We built PitchTok, where founders upload 90-second pitch videos and investors
swipe to discover startups. {X} investors are actively browsing this week.

Would you be open to uploading a quick video? Takes < 5 min.

{sender_name}
PitchTok

Unsubscribe: {unsubscribe_url}
PitchTok Inc, {physical_address}
```

**Email 2 (Day 3) — Follow-up**
```
Subject: "Re: Quick question about {company_name}"

Hey {first_name} — just bumping this. We had {X} founders get investor
meetings last week through video pitches. Happy to show you examples.

{sender_name}
```

**Email 3 (Day 7) — Breakup**
```
Subject: "Last try — {first_name}"

Final follow-up! If PitchTok isn't the right fit, no worries at all.
But if you're raising — video pitches are getting 3-5x more investor
eyeballs than cold decks right now. Link: {signup_link}

P.S. — If you know another founder fundraising, feel free to forward this.

{sender_name}
```

## Sending via SendGrid API

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENDGRID_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "personalizations": [{"to": [{"email": "{to_email}", "name": "{first_name}"}]}],
    "from": {"email": "outreach@pitchtok.com", "name": "{sender_name}"},
    "subject": "{subject}",
    "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "value": "{body}"}],
    "tracking_settings": {"open_tracking": {"enable": true}, "click_tracking": {"enable": true}},
    "headers": {"List-Unsubscribe": "<{unsubscribe_url}>"}
  }'
```

## Warmup Schedule
Track in `workspace/email/warmup-tracker.md`:

| Domain Age (weeks) | Max Emails/Day |
|---------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 20 |
| 4 | 35 |
| 5 | 50 |
| 6 | 75 |
| 7 | 100 |
| 8+ | 150 |

## A/B Testing
- Always send variant A to 50% and variant B to 50%
- Track opens and replies per variant in `workspace/email/ab-results.md`
- After 100 sends per variant, declare winner
- Stop sending loser variant

## Sequence Logic
- After Email 1: wait 3 days → send Email 2
- After Email 2: wait 4 days → send Email 3
- STOP if: reply received, bounce, unsubscribe, negative reply
- Track sequence state in `workspace/email/sequences/`

## Logging
Log every sent email to `workspace/email/sent-log.md`:
```
| Date | To | Subject | Variant | Sequence Step | Status |
```

## Suppression List
Maintain `workspace/email/suppression-list.md` — add anyone who:
- Replies with "unsubscribe", "stop", "remove me"
- Bounces
- Replies negatively
- Was already contacted in last 30 days
