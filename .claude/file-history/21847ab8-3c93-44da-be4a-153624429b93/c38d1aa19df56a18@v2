# LinkedIn Operations Skill

## CRITICAL RULE
**NEVER automate LinkedIn actions.** LinkedIn prohibits third-party automation.
This skill ONLY generates drafts. The human copies and sends manually.

## What You Do
1. Generate LinkedIn posts (3/week)
2. Generate connection request drafts
3. Generate DM sequence drafts
4. Prepare daily outreach queue (20 profiles/day)

## LinkedIn Post Generation (3/week)

### Monday: Tactical "How To" Post
```
HOOK (line 1 — must stop the scroll):
{Bold claim or question about fundraising}

BODY (8-12 short paragraphs, lots of line breaks):
{Actionable advice with specific examples}

CTA (last line):
{Question that invites comments}

HASHTAGS:
#startups #fundraising #venturecapital
```

### Wednesday: Hot Take / Debate Post
```
HOOK: "Unpopular opinion: {controversial but defensible take}"
BODY: Supporting arguments with data
CTA: "Agree or disagree? Drop your take below."
```

### Friday: Case Study / Social Proof Post
```
HOOK: "How {founder name} went from 0 to {X} investor intros in {Y} weeks"
BODY: Step-by-step breakdown
CTA: "Want to try this? DM me."
```

### For Each Post Generate:
- 3 hook variants (human picks best)
- Short version (< 200 words) + Long version (< 500 words)
- Comment bait question
- 3 relevant hashtags

## Connection Request Drafts (≤300 chars)

### Founder Lane
```
Hi {first_name} — saw {company} on {source}. Building something
investors are actively looking for on PitchTok. Would love to connect
and share what's working for {vertical} founders.
```

### Investor Lane
```
Hi {name} — we curate short pitch videos from vetted {vertical}
founders. Think TikTok meets deal flow. Would you be interested
in a weekly digest of top pitches? Happy to connect.
```

## DM Sequence Drafts

### DM 1 (After connection accepted, Day 0)
```
Thanks for connecting, {first_name}! Quick question —
have you considered using short video to pitch investors?
We're seeing {vertical} founders get 3-5x more investor
attention with 90-second pitch clips vs. cold decks.
Happy to share what's working if interested.
```

### DM 2 (Day 3, if no reply)
```
Hey {first_name} — just wanted to follow up. We have
{X} active investors on PitchTok this week specifically
looking at {vertical}. Takes 5 min to upload a video.
Want me to send the link?
```

### DM 3 (Day 7, breakup)
```
Last note from me! If timing isn't right, totally get it.
Here's our founder community link: {link}
Rooting for {company} either way! 🚀
```

## Daily Outreach Queue

Save to `workspace/linkedin/outreach-queue/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# LinkedIn Outreach Queue — {Date}

## Today's Targets (20 profiles)

### 1. {Founder Name} — {Company}
- LinkedIn: {url}
- Vertical: {vertical}
- Source: {how you found them}
- Score: {lead score}
- Connection Note: "{personalized note}"
- Status: [ ] Sent / [ ] Accepted / [ ] Replied

### 2. ...
(repeat for 20 profiles)

## Instructions
1. Open each LinkedIn profile
2. Copy connection note → Send
3. Mark status after sending
4. Log outcomes at end of day
```

## Safety Limits
- Max 5 connection requests/day (conservative)
- Max 10 messages/day to existing connections
- Max 20 profile views/day
- Keep acceptance rate above 35%
- NEVER use browser automation tools
