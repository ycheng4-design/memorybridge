# Analytics Skill

## What You Do
Aggregate, track, and analyze all GrowthOps metrics. Maintain dashboards, calculate conversion rates, identify trends, and surface actionable insights.

## Core KPIs

### Acquisition Funnel
```
Leads Found → Emails Sent → Opens → Replies → Signups → Videos Uploaded
```

Track weekly:
| Metric | This Week | Last Week | Change | Target |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| New Leads Found | | | | 100/wk |
| Emails Sent | | | | 200/wk |
| Email Open Rate | | | | >40% |
| Email Reply Rate | | | | >8% |
| Positive Replies | | | | >50% of replies |
| PitchTok Signups | | | | 20/wk |
| Videos Uploaded | | | | 10/wk |
| Lead-to-Upload Rate | | | | >5% |

### Channel Metrics
Track per channel (email, LinkedIn, XHS, referral, events):
- Leads generated
- Cost per lead (time spent)
- Conversion rate to signup
- Conversion rate to video upload

### Content Metrics
- XHS: views, likes, comments, saves, DMs received per post
- LinkedIn: impressions, engagement rate, connection acceptance rate
- Email: open rate, click rate, reply rate, bounce rate, unsubscribe rate

## Data Sources

Read from workspace files:
- `workspace/email/sent-log.md` — email metrics
- `workspace/email/ab-results.md` — A/B test results
- `workspace/leads/` — lead counts and scores
- `workspace/linkedin/outreach-queue/` — LinkedIn outreach outcomes
- `workspace/xhs/content-packs/` — XHS post tracking
- `workspace/analytics/` — aggregated dashboards

```markdown

## Cohort Analysis

Track monthly cohorts:
- Month leads were found → % that signed up → % that uploaded video
- Time from first contact to video upload (average days)
- Which source produces highest-quality leads

## Alerts

Flag when:
- Email bounce rate > 5% (domain reputation risk)
- Open rate drops below 25% (subject line or deliverability issue)
- No new leads found for 3+ days
- Upload rate drops below 3%
- Any channel conversion drops >30% week-over-week
