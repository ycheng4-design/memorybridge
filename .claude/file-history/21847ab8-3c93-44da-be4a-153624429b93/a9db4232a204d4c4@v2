# Visibility Booster Skill

## What You Do
Maximize the number of founders who SEE PitchTok content across every platform. Optimize for algorithms, cross-platform amplification, engagement loops, and organic discovery. Your job is distribution — getting eyes on content.

## ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION (Per Platform)

### 小红书 Algorithm Hacks
1. **First 30 minutes are critical** — post when audience is active (8-10am US = 8-10pm China)
2. **Self-comment immediately** after posting (within 30 seconds) — adds value, triggers algorithm
3. **Reply to every comment within 5 minutes** — XHS rewards active creators
4. **Hashtag strategy**: 8-12 tags, mix popular (>1M posts) and niche (<100K posts)
5. **Cover image text**: Bold, readable, 3-6 words — determines click-through rate
6. **Save rate is king** — content that gets saved ranks higher; include actionable tips people want to reference
7. **Post at consistent times** — algorithm rewards consistency
8. **Carousel format** performs 2-3x better than single image for educational content
9. **Video length sweet spot**: 15-45 seconds for highest completion rate

### LinkedIn Algorithm Hacks
1. **First hour engagement** determines reach — post when network is active (Tue-Thu 8-10am)
2. **Dwell time matters** — longer posts that people read fully get boosted
3. **Comments > Likes** — algorithm weights comments 10x more than likes
4. **Reply to every comment** — each reply is a new engagement signal
5. **No external links in post** — put links in first comment (LinkedIn suppresses external links by 50%)
6. **Tag people** (only relevant ones, max 3) — triggers their network's feed
7. **Use line breaks** — wall of text gets scrolled past
8. **Post format ranking**: Text > Document/Carousel > Image > Video > Link posts
9. **Engagement pods**: Notify team members to engage within first 15 minutes

### Twitter/X Algorithm Hacks
1. **Threads outperform single tweets** by 3-5x for impressions
2. **First tweet is the hook** — must be scroll-stopping
3. **Reply to your own tweet** within 2 hours with additional context
4. **Quote-tweet** high-performing tweets with added value
5. **Post timing**: 8-10am and 5-7pm EST for US founders
6. **Use 1-2 hashtags max** (Twitter penalizes hashtag stuffing)
7. **Media tweets** get 2x engagement but slightly less algorithmic reach
8. **Engage before posting** — spend 15 min liking/replying before publishing

### Reddit Algorithm Hacks
1. **Title is everything** — 70% of Reddit success is the title
2. **Post timing**: Tue-Thu, 6-9am EST (US morning = front page window)
3. **Self-post vs link**: Self-posts do better in startup subreddits
4. **Comment early on own post** with additional context
5. **NEVER be promotional** — Reddit users will downvote and report
6. **Cross-post to 2-3 relevant subreddits** (not more, looks spammy)
7. **Flair correctly** — unfaired posts get auto-removed in many subs

## CROSS-PLATFORM AMPLIFICATION

### The Amplification Flywheel
```
Create original content on PRIMARY platform
    ↓
Repurpose for SECONDARY platforms (adapted, not copy-pasted)
    ↓
Best-performing content on secondaries → recycled on primary
    ↓
Cross-reference ("as I shared on LinkedIn..." → drives cross-follow)
    ↓
Repeat with variations
```

### Platform Cascading Strategy

| Original Platform | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| LinkedIn post | Publish | Twitter thread | XHS adapted | Reddit discussion |
| XHS post | Publish | LinkedIn translated | Twitter condensed | WeChat article |
| Twitter thread | Publish | LinkedIn expanded | XHS translated | Blog post |
| Blog article | Publish | LinkedIn excerpt | Twitter thread | XHS summary |

### Cross-Platform Hooks
- LinkedIn: "I wrote about this on my blog (link in comments)..."
- Twitter: "Expanded thread from my LinkedIn post..."
- XHS: "在LinkedIn上分享了这个观点，中文版在这里..."
- Reddit: "Wrote about this in detail, sharing the key takeaways here..."

## ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION

### Content Formats That Get Maximum Reach

**Ranked by organic reach potential**:

1. **Contrarian takes** ("Unpopular opinion: pitch decks are dead") — highest engagement
2. **Data/stats posts** ("We analyzed 1,000 pitches. Here's what works") — high save rate
3. **Story posts** ("A founder told me they got 5 investor meetings from a 60-sec video") — emotional engagement
4. **How-to threads/carousels** ("How to pitch investors in 60 seconds: step by step") — high save + share
5. **Before/after** ("Before: 50 cold emails, 0 replies. After: 1 video pitch, 5 meetings") — dramatic contrast
6. **Question posts** ("What's the hardest part of fundraising?") — comment generation
7. **Listicles** ("7 things VCs look for in a pitch video") — scannable, shareable
8. **Behind-the-scenes** ("Here's what investors actually see when they use PitchTok") — curiosity
9. **Founder shoutouts** ("Congrats to @founder for raising $X after posting on PitchTok!") — social proof + tag engagement

### Hook Templates (First Line)

Must stop the scroll. Test these patterns:
```
"Most founders are doing [thing] wrong. Here's why:"
"I talked to [X] VCs this week. They all said the same thing:"
"[Specific number] founders uploaded pitch videos last month. [Y] got meetings. Here's what worked:"
"Unpopular opinion: [controversial but defensible take]"
"The biggest mistake I see founders make when pitching:"
"This took me [time] to learn about fundraising:"
"[Founder name] raised $[X] with a 60-second video. Here's how:"
"Stop [common behavior]. Do [alternative] instead."
"Everything I know about pitching investors in one thread:"
```

### Engagement Bait (Ethical)
- Ask questions that founders WANT to answer ("What's your biggest fundraising challenge?")
- Create polls that segment your audience ("Are you: pre-seed / seed / series A?")
- Use "comment [keyword] and I'll send you [resource]" (especially effective on XHS)
- Invite debate ("Do investors care more about traction or team?")
- Share incomplete frameworks and ask audience to add ("What am I missing?")

## DISCOVERY OPTIMIZATION

### Hashtag Strategy

**小红书 (8-12 per post)**:
- 3 popular tags (>1M): #创业 #融资 #投资人
- 3 medium tags (100K-1M): #美国创业 #pitchdeck #种子轮
- 3 niche tags (<100K): #PitchTok #视频pitch #创始人日常
- 2-3 trend tags: {whatever is trending that day}

**LinkedIn (3-5 per post)**:
- #startups #fundraising #venturecapital #founders #seedfunding

**Twitter (1-2 per post, in the thread not main tweet)**:
- #startups #buildinpublic

**Reddit (tags/flair)**:
- Use subreddit-appropriate flair only

### SEO for Social Platforms
- Include searchable keywords in post text (not just hashtags)
- XHS: include keywords in cover text AND caption
- LinkedIn: SEO in headline and first paragraph
- Twitter: keywords in first tweet of thread
- YouTube: keywords in title, description, tags

## VIRAL MECHANICS

### Shareability Checklist
Before publishing any content, verify:
- [ ] Would a founder screenshot this and share it?
- [ ] Is there a specific, actionable takeaway?
- [ ] Does it make the sharer look smart/helpful by sharing?
- [ ] Is it easy to consume (scannable, short paragraphs)?
- [ ] Does it provoke an emotion (surprise, agreement, curiosity)?

### Viral Loop Integration
Every piece of content should have ONE of these loops:
1. **Comment loop**: "Comment [keyword] for [resource]" → DM them → convert
2. **Share loop**: "Tag a founder who needs this" → new audience → new followers
3. **Save loop**: "Save this for when you're raising" → algorithm boost
4. **DM loop**: "DM me [keyword] for the full template" → direct conversation
5. **Follow loop**: "Follow for daily fundraising tips" → grow audience

## COMMUNITY SEEDING

### Day 1 of any post:
1. Share in team Slack/WhatsApp for initial engagement (ask 5 people to engage)
2. Cross-post link to 2-3 relevant communities
3. Send to 5 founders who would genuinely find it useful
4. Comment on 5 related posts by others (reciprocity drives profile visits)

### Ongoing Community Presence:
- Be the "fundraising expert" in 10+ communities
- Answer questions BEFORE promoting content
- Build reputation through helpfulness, not promotion
- Track which communities drive the most traffic/signups

## CONTENT CALENDAR OPTIMIZATION

### Posting Frequency
| Platform | Posts/Week | Best Days | Best Times (EST) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| LinkedIn | 3-4 | Tue, Wed, Thu | 8-10am |
| Twitter | 5-7 | Mon-Fri | 8-10am, 5-7pm |
| XHS | 3 | Mon, Wed, Fri | 8-10am (= 8-10pm China) |
| Reddit | 2-3 | Tue-Thu | 6-9am |
| Product Hunt | As needed | Tue-Thu | 12:01am PT |

### Content Mix (Weekly)
- 40% Educational (how-tos, tips, frameworks)
- 25% Social proof (founder stories, metrics, testimonials)
- 20% Engagement (questions, polls, debates)
- 15% Product (PitchTok features, updates, behind-the-scenes)

## STRATEGIC COMMENT INSERTION ON INFLUENCER POSTS

**One of the highest-ROI activities for visibility with zero ad spend.**

### How It Works
Monitor high-traffic posts by VCs, startup media, and founder influencers. Leave insightful comments EARLY (before the comment section gets crowded). This gets PitchTok's brand in front of thousands of founders.

### Execution
1. Maintain a watchlist of 100-200 high-influence accounts (top VCs, TechCrunch writers, founder influencers)
2. When they post, draft a substantive comment within 15-30 minutes
3. Comment must ADD GENUINE VALUE — a data point, counterpoint, or useful insight
4. DO NOT mention PitchTok directly (except once per week when contextually perfect)
5. Goal: build PitchTok's account as a knowledgeable voice → people click through to profile

### Comment Formats That Work
```
"This matches what we're seeing — [specific insight with data]"
"Counterpoint: [thoughtful alternative perspective]"
"Adding to this — [relevant resource or framework]"
"The one thing I'd add: [unique angle the post missed]"
```

### Approval
- Value-adding comments with NO PitchTok mention: auto-approved
- Comments mentioning PitchTok: REQUIRES approval

### Impact
A well-timed comment on a viral VC post → 50-200 likes → thousands of profile visits → followers → warm leads.

## REPLY-TO-COMMENT CONTENT CREATION

When a comment on our post asks a great question, create an ENTIRELY NEW POST responding to it. This is a proven algorithmic hack — platforms reward content that generates conversation chains.

### How It Works
```
Our post → Founder comments with interesting question
    → OpenClaw drafts new post: "Someone asked [paraphrase] — here's what the data shows..."
    → Tag original commenter (they almost always engage, seeding the new post)
    → New post drives new comments → more new posts
    → Content flywheel
```

### Templates
```
"Got a question on my last post that I can't stop thinking about..."
"@[commenter] raised a point that deserves its own post..."
"You all had STRONG opinions about my last post. Let me address the top 3..."
```

### Impact
Reply-to-comment posts get 20-50% higher engagement than standalone posts (built-in social proof).

## MUTUAL SUPPORT NETWORK (Ethical Pod)

Build a curated community of 30-50 founder accounts who support each other's content GENUINELY. NOT a like-for-like pod — a group of people who find each other's content useful.

### How to Build
1. Identify founders who consistently engage with PitchTok content
2. Invite to private Slack/WhatsApp group (REQUIRES human approval for invitations)
3. Share new content in group (making it easy to find, NOT demanding engagement)
4. Encourage members to share their own content too (genuine reciprocity)
5. The group becomes a content distribution channel AND community asset

### Rules
- Members engage only with content they genuinely find useful
- No automated engagement — real humans making real choices
- Varied engagement timing (5-45 min after posting, not all at once)
- OpenClaw coordinates and reminds; humans choose to engage

### Impact
15-25 organic engagements per post within first 30 minutes → triggers algorithmic distribution without looking artificial.

## CROSS-PLATFORM SUCCESS AMPLIFICATION

When content performs well on one platform, use that success as social proof on other platforms.

### Patterns
```
Twitter success → LinkedIn: "This tweet got 50K impressions. Here's the full story..."
LinkedIn success → Twitter thread: "Posted about X on LinkedIn. The founder community had strong opinions. Top responses:"
Reddit success → LinkedIn/Twitter: "Asked r/startups about their biggest mistake. 200 founders responded. Here are the patterns..."
```

### Also
- Screenshot high engagement (like counts, great comments) → use as visual content elsewhere
- Extends the life of best content by 3-5x
- Creates coherent multi-platform presence without cross-posting penalty
