Your goal is to help the user integrate a design system into an existing codebase in a way that is visually consistent, maintainable, and idiomatic to their tech stack.\n\nBefore proposing or writing any code, first build a clear mental model of the current system:\n- Identify the tech stack (e.g. React, Next.js, Vue, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, etc.).\n- Understand the existing design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows), global styles, and utility patterns.\n- Review the current component architecture (atoms/molecules/organisms, layout primitives, etc.) and naming conventions.\n- Note any constraints (legacy CSS, design library in use, performance or bundle-size considerations).\n\nAsk the user focused questions to understand the user's goals. Do they want:\n- a specific component or page redesigned in the new style,\n- existing components refactored to the new system, or\n- new pages/features built entirely in the new style?\n\nOnce you understand the context and scope, do the following:\n- Propose a concise implementation plan that follows best practices, prioritizing:\n  - centralizing design tokens,\n  - reusability and composability of components,\n  - minimizing duplication and one-off styles,\n  - long-term maintainability and clear naming.\n- When writing code, match the user’s existing patterns (folder structure, naming, styling approach, and component patterns).\n- Explain your reasoning briefly as you go, so the user understands *why* you’re making certain architectural or design choices.\n\nAlways aim to:\n- Preserve or improve accessibility.\n- Maintain visual consistency with the provided design system.\n- Leave the codebase in a cleaner, more coherent state than you found it.\n- Ensure layouts are responsive and usable across devices.\n- Make deliberate, creative design choices (layout, motion, interaction details, and typography) that express the design system’s personality instead of producing a generic or boilerplate UI.\n\n</role>\n\n<design-system>\n# High-Fidelity Claymorphism Design System\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\n**Core Concept: Digital Clay**\nThis design system is not merely a \"soft UI\"—it is a high-fidelity simulation of a tangible, physical world constructed from **premium digital clay**. Every element on the screen should evoke the sensation of holding a high-end, matte-finish vinyl toy or a soft, air-filled silicone object. It rejects the flatness of modern minimalism in favor of volume, weight, and tactility.\n\n**The \"High-Fidelity\" Difference**:\nUnlike early 2020s \"Neumorphism\" (which felt like extruded plastic) or basic \"Claymorphism\" (which often feels like flat vector art), **High-Fidelity Claymorphism** relies on complex, multi-layered lighting simulation using 4-layer shadow stacks. It renders objects that feel dense, substantial, and interactive—not hollow decorations.\n\n*   **Materiality**: Think of soft-touch matte silicone, marshmallow-like foam, or high-quality injection-molded plastic with a premium finish. Surfaces absorb light rather than reflecting it sharply, creating a warm, inviting aesthetic.\n*   **Lighting**: The \"world\" is lit by a soft, diffused overhead light source positioned top-left, creating deep ambient occlusion shadows below objects and gentle specular highlights on their upper ridges. This creates the illusion of physical depth.\n*   **Shadow Architecture**: Every element uses carefully crafted multi-layer shadows:\n    - **Outer shadows**: Soft, colored drop shadows that define distance from the surface\n    - **Highlight shadows**: Top-left highlights that simulate light reflection\n    - **Inner shadows**: Subtle colored reflections and rim lights that add dimensionality\n    - **Active states**: Pressed elements use inset shadows to simulate physical depression\n\n**The Sensory Vibe**:\n*   **Playful & Optimistic**: The interface radiates joy through \"candy store\" colors (vivid violets, hot pinks, sky blues, emerald greens, amber oranges) and bouncy, organic motion. It feels safe, welcoming, and unpretentious—like a premium toy store display.\n*   **Tactile & Responsive**: Elements don't just change color when interacted with—they physically react with exaggerated realism. Buttons actively \"squish\" (scale-[0.92] + shadow-clayPressed) and compress under the cursor. Cards lift and float towards the user (-translate-y-2 with enhanced shadows). Every interaction provides satisfying visual feedback.\n*   **Friendly & Safe**: There are **zero sharp corners** in this universe. Every edge is aggressively rounded (`rounded-[20px]` minimum, up to `rounded-[60px]` for large containers), subconsciously signaling safety and approachability to the user. The design language speaks \"friendly\" and \"accessible\" without words.\n*   **Premium Craft**: Despite the playfulness, this aesthetic maintains a sense of quality through careful attention to detail: consistent border radii, precise shadow layering, harmonious color relationships, and smooth micro-interactions.\n\n**The \"Clay\" Physics Engine**:\n1.  **Convexity (The Bulge)**: Primary interactive elements (Buttons, Stat orbs, Feature cards) bulge OUT towards the user with `shadow-clayButton` or `shadow-clayCard`. They capture light on their top-left edge and cast soft colored shadows below, creating the illusion of floating above the surface.\n2.  **Concavity (The Press)**: Secondary surfaces (Input fields, Active button states, FAQ panels when open) are pressed INTO the clay surface with `shadow-clayPressed`. They cast internal shadows on their top edge and catch light on their bottom lip, making them feel recessed.\n3.  **Buoyancy (The Float)**: The interface exists in a zero-gravity environment with high air resistance. Background blobs drift slowly (8-12s animations with translateY and rotate). Cards hover effortlessly with hover states that amplify the float effect. Nothing feels statically \"stuck\" to the grid—everything breathes and moves subtly.\n4.  **Micro-Physics**: Hover states consistently lift elements upward (`hover:-translate-y-1` to `-translate-y-2`) while enhancing their shadows, simulating the element floating closer to the viewer. Active/pressed states do the opposite—compressing downward with reduced shadows.\n\n---\n\n## Design Token System\n\n### Colors (The \"Candy Shop\" Palette)\n\n**Background**:\n*   **Canvas**: `#F4F1FA` (Very pale, cool lavender-white). This provides a cleaner, more modern base than warm beige. Never use pure white—the slight tint creates warmth.\n\n**Foreground**:\n*   **Text (Primary)**: `#332F3A` (Soft Charcoal). High contrast (passing WCAG AA) but softer than black for a friendlier feel.\n*   **Muted (Secondary)**: `#635F69` (Dark Lavender-Gray). Crucial for readability against light backgrounds. Use for body text, labels, and secondary information. Never go lighter than this value.\n\n**Accents (Vibrant & Saturated)**:\n*   **Primary Accent**: `#7C3AED` (Vivid Violet). The hero color used for primary CTAs, links, and brand emphasis.\n*   **Secondary Accent**: `#DB2777` (Hot Pink). Used in gradients and for secondary emphasis.\n*   **Tertiary**: `#0EA5E9` (Sky Blue). For informational elements and background blobs.\n*   **Success/Benefits**: `#10B981` (Emerald Green). For checkmarks and positive indicators.\n*   **Warning**: `#F59E0B` (Amber). For alerts and star ratings.\n\n**Gradient Strategy**:\n*   **Primary Buttons**: `bg-gradient-to-br from-[#A78BFA] to-[#7C3AED]` (lighter violet to primary violet). This creates depth and prevents overly dark buttons.\n*   **Icon Orbs**: `bg-gradient-to-br` from light pastel (400) to saturated hue (600) with varied colors for visual interest (e.g., `from-blue-400 to-blue-600`, `from-purple-400 to-purple-600`, `from-pink-400 to-pink-600`).\n*   **Text Highlights**: Use multi-stop gradients for hero text (`clay-text-gradient`): `from-clay-foreground 20%, to-clay-accent 60%, to-clay-accent-alt`. Keep gradient text large (text-5xl+) for readability.\n*   **Background Blobs**: Semi-transparent accent colors with 10% opacity and blur-3xl for soft ambient lighting.\n\n### Typography\n\n**Font Selection**:\n*   **Headings**: **Nunito** (Google Fonts, Weights: 700/800/900). The rounded terminals perfectly complement the soft clay aesthetic. Apply via inline styles: `style={{ fontFamily: \"Nunito, sans-serif\" }}` for all headings, stat numbers, and emphasis text.\n*   **Body**: **DM Sans** (Google Fonts, Weights: 400/500/700). Geometric, clean, and highly readable. Applied globally via body font-family.\n\n**Hierarchy (Mobile-First with Progressive Enhancement)**:\n*   **Hero Headline**: `text-5xl sm:text-6xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl`, Black weight (font-black), tight tracking (tracking-tight), line-height 1.1. Always use Nunito.\n*   **Section Titles**: `text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl`, Extrabold (font-extrabold) or Black. Always use Nunito.\n*   **Card Titles**: `text-xl` to `text-2xl` (larger for hero cards: `text-3xl`), Bold (font-bold) to Extrabold. Use Nunito.\n*   **Body Text**: `text-base` to `text-lg`, Medium weight (font-medium), relaxed leading (leading-relaxed). Use DM Sans.\n*   **Small Text**: `text-sm` to `text-xs`, Medium to Bold weight. Use for labels, metadata, uppercase tracking-wide treatments.\n\n**Typography Best Practices**:\n*   Always pair Nunito headings with DM Sans body for optimal hierarchy.\n*   Use `font-black` (900 weight) for maximum impact on large headings and numbers.\n*   Ensure line-height is generous: `leading-relaxed` (1.625) for body, `leading-[1.1]` for tight display headings.\n*   Limit line length to 60-75 characters with max-w-2xl to max-w-3xl containers for optimal readability.\n*   Use `tracking-tight` on large headings to maintain visual density, `tracking-wide` or `tracking-widest` on small caps/labels.\n\n### Shapes & Radii\n\n**The \"Super-Rounded\" Rule** (Absolute Values Only):\n*   **Large Containers/Hero Sections**: `rounded-[48px]` to `rounded-[60px]`\n*   **Standard Cards**: `rounded-[32px]` (the default for most cards)\n*   **Medium Elements** (Benefits pills, Blog cards): `rounded-[24px]`\n*   **Buttons & Inputs**: `rounded-[20px]` or `rounded-2xl`\n*   **Icon Containers**: `rounded-2xl` (16px) for square icons, `rounded-full` for circular\n*   **Small Badges**: `rounded-lg` (8px) minimum, `rounded-full` preferred\n*   **Stat Orbs**: `rounded-full` (perfect circles)\n\n**Critical Rules**:\n*   Never use `rounded-md` (4px) or `rounded-sm`. They appear too sharp and generic for this aesthetic.\n*   Maintain consistency: if a card uses `rounded-[32px]`, its nested image should use `rounded-[24px]` (8px less) to create visual hierarchy.\n*   On mobile, you may reduce radii slightly (e.g., `rounded-[32px] sm:rounded-[40px]`) to maximize screen real estate while maintaining the soft aesthetic.\n\n### Shadows (The Engine of Clay)\n\nThis system uses a **High-Fidelity Shadow Stack** to simulate complex lighting.\n\n**1. Deep Clay (Surface)**:\nFor the main background elements or large containers.\n```css\nbox-shadow: \n  30px 30px 60px #cdc6d9,           /* Deep, soft ambient occlusion */\n  -30px -30px 60px #ffffff,         /* Top-left ambient light */\n  inset 10px 10px 20px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.05), /* Subtle color reflection */\n  inset -10px -10px 20px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); /* Surface specularity */\n```\n\n**2. Clay Card (Floating)**:\nFor standard content cards.\n```css\nbox-shadow: \n  16px 16px 32px rgba(160, 150, 180, 0.2), /* Soft purple-gray drop shadow */\n  -10px -10px 24px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9), /* Strong top-left highlight */\n  inset 6px 6px 12px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.03), /* Inner colored bounce light */\n  inset -6px -6px 12px rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); /* Inner rim light */\n```\n\n**3. Clay Button (High Convexity)**:\nFor clickable elements.\n```css\nbox-shadow: \n  12px 12px 24px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.3), /* Strong colored drop shadow */\n  -8px -8px 16px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4), /* Top-left highlight */\n  inset 4px 4px 8px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4), /* Inner rim */\n  inset -4px -4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Bottom-right shading */\n```\n\n**4. Clay Pressed (Recessed)**:\nFor inputs and active states.\n```css\nbox-shadow: \n  inset 10px 10px 20px #d9d4e3, /* Deep inner shadow top-left */\n  inset -10px -10px 20px #ffffff; /* Inner highlight bottom-right */\n```\n\n---\n\n## Component Architecture\n\n### 1. The Universal Card (`Card`)\n*   **Base Styles**: `relative overflow-hidden rounded-[32px] bg-clay-cardBg p-8 text-clay-foreground shadow-clayCard backdrop-blur-xl`\n*   **Interactive States**:\n    *   Default: `shadow-clayCard` (4-layer shadow with soft depth)\n    *   Hover: `hover:-translate-y-2 hover:shadow-[enhanced]` (lifted with stronger shadow)\n    *   Transition: `transition-all duration-500` (smooth, premium feel)\n*   **Structure**:\n    *   Outer wrapper handles positioning, overflow, shadows\n    *   **Inner Content Wrapper**: `<div className=\"relative z-10 flex h-full flex-col\">{children}</div>` to support absolute positioned decorative elements\n*   **Decorations**: Use absolute positioned panels with negative margins (`-bottom-8 -left-8 -right-8`) to create \"peeking\" UI elements that emerge from card bottoms\n*   **Variants**:\n    *   Glass effect: `bg-white/60` to `bg-white/80`\n    *   Solid: `bg-white`\n    *   Feature hero card: `md:col-span-2 md:row-span-2` with larger internal padding\n\n### 2. The Clay Button (`Button`)\n*   **Base Shape**: `rounded-[20px]` with chunky height (`h-14` default, `h-16` for lg)\n*   **Base Styles**: `inline-flex items-center justify-center font-bold tracking-wide transition-all duration-200`\n*   **Variants**:\n    *   **Primary/Default**: `bg-gradient-to-br from-[#A78BFA] to-[#7C3AED] text-white shadow-clayButton hover:shadow-clayButtonHover`\n    *   **Secondary**: `bg-white text-clay-foreground shadow-clayButton`\n    *   **Outline**: `border-2 border-clay-accent/20 bg-transparent text-clay-accent hover:border-clay-accent hover:bg-clay-accent/5`\n    *   **Ghost**: `text-clay-foreground hover:bg-clay-accent/10 hover:text-clay-accent`\n*   **Interactive States**:\n    *   Hover: `hover:-translate-y-1` (lift up 4px) + Enhanced shadow\n    *   Active: `active:scale-[0.92] active:shadow-clayPressed` (pronounced squish effect)\n    *   Focus: `focus-visible:ring-4 focus-visible:ring-clay-accent/30 focus-visible:ring-offset-2`\n*   **Sizing**: Use `size` prop: `sm` (h-11), `default` (h-14), `lg` (h-16)\n\n### 3. The Recessed Input (`Input`)\n*   **Base Shape**: `rounded-2xl` with generous height `h-16`\n*   **Base Styles**: `flex w-full border-0 bg-[#EFEBF5] px-6 py-4 text-clay-foreground text-lg shadow-clayPressed`\n*   **States**:\n    *   Default: Recessed with `shadow-clayPressed` (inset shadows)\n    *   Focus: `focus:bg-white focus:ring-4 focus:ring-clay-accent/20` (transforms to raised white surface)\n    *   Placeholder: `placeholder:text-clay-muted`\n*   **Accessibility**: `transition-all duration-200` for smooth state changes\n\n### 4. Floating 3D Blobs (Background)\n**Never use a flat background.** Always include 3-4 large, animated blobs.\n*   **Container**: `<div className=\"pointer-events-none fixed inset-0 overflow-hidden -z-10\">`\n*   **Individual Blobs**:\n    *   Classes: `absolute h-[60vh] w-[60vh] rounded-full blur-3xl`\n    *   Colors: Accent colors with `/10` opacity (e.g., `bg-[#8B5CF6]/10`, `bg-[#EC4899]/10`, `bg-[#0EA5E9]/10`)\n    *   Positioning: Negative margins to bleed off edges (`-top-[10%] -left-[10%]`, `-right-[10%] top-[20%]`)\n    *   Animation: `clay-blob` or `clay-blob-alt` with staggered `animation-delay-2000` or `animation-delay-4000`\n*   **Purpose**: Creates ambient colored lighting that shows through glass-morphic cards\n\n---\n\n## Animation System\n\n**1. Clay Float (`clay-float`)**:\nSimulates zero-gravity drift for background blobs. 8 second duration.\n```css\n@keyframes clay-float {\n  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0) rotate(0deg); }\n  50% { transform: translateY(-20px) rotate(2deg); }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Clay Float Delayed (`clay-float-delayed`)**:\nAlternative animation with opposite rotation. 10 second duration.\n```css\n@keyframes clay-float-delayed {\n  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0) rotate(0deg); }\n  50% { transform: translateY(-15px) rotate(-2deg); }\n}\n```\n\n**3. Clay Float Slow (`clay-float-slow`)**:\nFor hero decorative elements that orbit the headline. 12 second duration with more pronounced movement.\n```css\n@keyframes clay-float-slow {\n  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0) rotate(0deg); }\n  50% { transform: translateY(-30px) rotate(5deg); }\n}\n```\n\n**4. Clay Breathe (`clay-breathe`)**:\nSimulates an object inflating/deflating slightly. 6 second duration. Used on stat orbs.\n```css\n@keyframes clay-breathe {\n  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }\n  50% { transform: scale(1.02); }\n}\n```\n\n**5. Hover Lift**:\nStandard interactive elements should lift upward on hover:\n*   Cards: `hover:-translate-y-2` (8px) with enhanced shadow\n*   Benefits pills: `hover:-translate-y-1` (4px)\n*   Testimonials: `hover:-translate-y-2` (8px)\n*   Blog posts: `hover:-translate-y-3` (12px) for dramatic effect\n*   Buttons: `hover:-translate-y-1` (4px) with shadow enhancement\n\n**6. Active Press**:\nButtons use `active:scale-[0.92]` combined with `active:shadow-clayPressed` to simulate a physical squish when clicked. Duration should be fast (200ms) for immediate feedback.\n\n**7. Scale Transforms**:\n*   Stat orbs: `hover:scale-110` (10% growth)\n*   How It Works circles: `group-hover:scale-110` with 300ms duration\n*   Pricing cards (non-highlighted): `hover:scale-105` (5% subtle growth)\n*   Featured card in Bento grid: `hover:scale-[1.02]` (minimal growth due to large size)\n\n**8. Animation Delays**:\nUse staggered animations for visual rhythm:\n*   `.animation-delay-2000` (2s delay)\n*   `.animation-delay-4000` (4s delay)\n\n**9. Reduced Motion**:\nAlways include `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to disable all animations for accessibility.\n\n---\n\n## Layout Patterns\n\n**1. Masonry / Bento Grid**:\n*   Don't use uniform grids. Mix `col-span-1` with `col-span-2` or `row-span-2` cards.\n*   Use `hover:scale-[1.02]` on large grid items for a tactile feel.\n\n**2. Split Layouts**:\n*   Use 50/50 splits for \"Product\" or \"Benefits\" sections.\n*   One side text, one side **Abstract 3D Composition** (nested clay shapes, not just an image).\n\n**3. Overlapping Elements**:\n*   Allow elements to break their containers (e.g., a \"Popular\" badge floating *above* a pricing card).\n*   Use negative margins to pull decorative elements to the edges.\n\n---\n\n## Responsive Strategy\n\n**Mobile-First Approach with Progressive Enhancement**\n\nThe Clay design system maintains its playful, tactile personality across all screen sizes while adapting layouts and sizing for optimal mobile experience.\n\n**Typography Scaling**:\n*   Hero headlines: `text-5xl → sm:text-6xl → md:text-7xl → lg:text-8xl`\n*   Section titles: `text-3xl → sm:text-4xl → md:text-5xl`\n*   Body text: `text-base → sm:text-lg → md:text-xl` where appropriate\n*   Always maintain `leading-relaxed` and proper line length constraints\n\n**Layout Transformations**:\n*   **Navigation**: Compact on mobile (`h-16 rounded-[32px] px-4`) → Larger on desktop (`sm:h-20 sm:rounded-[40px] sm:px-8`). Hide non-essential nav items on mobile.\n*   **Hero**: Stack CTAs vertically (`flex-col gap-6`) → Horizontal on desktop (`sm:flex-row`)\n*   **Stats**: 2-column grid on mobile (`grid-cols-2 gap-6`) → 4 columns on desktop (`md:grid-cols-4 gap-8`)\n*   **Features**: Single column → Bento layout with spans on desktop (`md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` with hero card `md:col-span-2 md:row-span-2`)\n*   **Benefits/Product Detail**: Stack vertically on mobile → Side-by-side split on desktop (`lg:grid-cols-2`)\n*   **Pricing**: Stack cards on mobile → 3 columns on desktop (`md:grid-cols-3`). Scale effect for highlighted card only applies on desktop (`md:scale-110`)\n\n**Component Adjustments**:\n*   **Cards**: Reduce padding on mobile (`p-6 sm:p-8`)\n*   **Border Radii**: Maintain generous radii even on mobile (never less than `rounded-[20px]`)\n*   **Buttons**: Full width on mobile (`w-full sm:w-auto`) for primary CTAs\n*   **Decorative Elements**: Hide some floating shapes on mobile (`hidden lg:block`)\n*   **Shadows**: Keep full shadow stacks—they're essential to the aesthetic\n\n**Touch Targets**:\n*   All interactive elements meet 44px minimum tap target (buttons are `h-14+`)\n*   Increase spacing in mobile navigation for easier tapping\n*   Ensure accordion FAQ items have adequate vertical spacing\n\n**Performance**:\n*   Animations still run on mobile but respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n*   Blur effects (`backdrop-blur-xl`) remain—they're critical to the glass-clay aesthetic\n*   Background blobs scale with viewport units (`vh`) so they adapt naturally\n\n**What NOT to Change on Mobile**:\n*   Don't flatten the design—keep the shadows and depth\n*   Don't reduce border radii to generic values\n*   Don't remove the candy-store colors or make them muted\n*   Don't disable all animations (only simplify if performance issues arise)\n\n---\n\n## Dos and Don'ts\n\n*   **DO** use pronounced \"Squish\" animations on click (`active:scale-[0.92]` combined with `shadow-clayPressed`).\n*   **DO** use varying border radii within components (e.g., `rounded-[48px]` for outer container, `rounded-[32px]` for card, `rounded-[24px]` for inner image).\n*   **DO** use \"Glass-Clay\" hybrid (semi-transparent white `bg-white/60` to `/80` + `backdrop-blur-xl`) for cards to reveal background blobs.\n*   **DO** use multi-layer shadow stacks (4 shadows minimum) to achieve high-fidelity depth.\n*   **DO** apply Nunito font family explicitly to all headings, numbers, and labels via inline styles.\n*   **DO** use vibrant gradient backgrounds for icon containers with varied colors (blue, purple, pink, green, cyan, amber).\n*   **DON'T** use gray text lighter than `#635F69`. This is the minimum for accessibility against light backgrounds.\n*   **DON'T** use sharp corners anywhere. Minimum radius is `rounded-[20px]`, never `rounded-md` or `rounded-lg`.\n*   **DON'T** use flat colors for backgrounds. Always include animated blobs or subtle gradients.\n*   **DON'T** use gradient text for font sizes smaller than `text-5xl` (readability risk).\n*   **DON'T** make buttons too small. Minimum height is `h-11` (44px) for accessibility.\n*   **DON'T** skip the hover lift effect on interactive elements—it's core to the tactile feel.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n- [ ] **Background**: Canvas `#F4F1FA` + Animated Blobs.\n- [ ] **Shadows**: 4-layer box-shadows defined in CSS.\n- [ ] **Typography**: Nunito Black (Headings) + DM Sans (Body).\n- [ ] **Buttons**: Gradient, rounded-2xl, click-squish.\n- [ ] **Cards**: White/60%, backdrop-blur, rounded-3xl.\n- [ ] **Text**: High contrast charcoal/slate, no light grays.\n</design-system>"}]},"uuid":"51211b9e-8f43-4d6b-878f-87f0bf2c3608","timestamp":"2026-01-17T22:31:46.704Z"}

Based on my exploration, I have all the information needed:\n\n## Comprehensive Codebase Analysis: Badminton Video Analyzer\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the codebase, here's a detailed summary of the frontend tech stack, styling approach, and architecture:\n\n### 1. Tech Stack\n\n**Framework & Core:**\n- **React** 19.2.0 - Main UI framework\n- **React Router DOM** 7.12.0 - Client-side routing and navigation\n- **Vite** 7.2.4 - Build tool and development server\n- **Node** (Module type: ES Modules)\n\n**Backend Integration:**\n- **Supabase JS** 2.90.1 - Authentication and database client\n- **MediaPipe Tasks Vision** 0.10.22-rc - For pose detection and skeleton tracking\n\n**Build & Development:**\n- ESLint 9.39.1 - Code linting with React hooks and refresh plugins\n- Vite React plugin 5.1.1 - Fast refresh support\n- TypeScript types available (@types/react, @types/react-dom)\n\n**Location:** `c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend`\n\n---\n\n### 2. Styling Approach\n\n**NO Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or styled-components**\n\nThe project uses **inline styles with JavaScript objects** throughout. Key styling patterns:\n\n- **Global Styles**: `/src/index.css` - Base CSS variables, typography, button, and form styles\n- **Component Styles**: Each component defines a `styles` object with inline CSS\n- **Color Palette Used:**\n  - Green: `#4CAF50` (primary action)\n  - Blue: `#2196F3` (secondary actions)\n  - Orange: `#FF9800` (accent)\n  - Red: `#f44336` (danger)\n  - Gray: `#f5f5f5` (backgrounds)\n  - Dark: `#1a1a1a`, `#2d2d2d` (dark theme)\n\n**Key CSS Files:**\n- `/src/index.css` (1,154 bytes) - Global styles with light/dark mode support\n- `/src/App.css` (606 bytes) - App layout styles\n- Per-component CSS objects defined inline\n\n---\n\n### 3. Existing Design Tokens & Theme Configuration\n\n**No centralized design token system exists currently.** \n\nHowever, implicit tokens are scattered across components:\n- **Spacing**: `0.5rem`, `1rem`, `1.5rem`, `2rem`\n- **Border Radius**: `4px`, `8px`, `12px`\n- **Box Shadows**: `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`, `0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`\n- **Colors**: Hardcoded across components\n- **Typography**: System fonts via `font-family: system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`\n- **Responsive breakpoints**: No explicit breakpoints; flexbox and grid used organically\n\n---\n\n### 4. Component Architecture & Folder Structure\n\n```\nfrontend/src/\n├── main.jsx                    # Entry point\n├── App.jsx                     # Main router and protected routes\n├── App.css                     # Main styles\n├── index.css                   # Global styles\n├── assets/                     # Static assets\n├── components/\n│   └── LanguageSelector.jsx    # Language switcher component\n├── context/\n│   ├── AuthContext.jsx         # Auth state & methods (signUp, signIn, signOut)\n│   └── LanguageContext.jsx     # i18n support (en, zh, es)\n├── lib/\n│   └── supabase.js             # Supabase client initialization\n└── pages/\n    ├── Login.jsx               # Auth page (sign in/sign up form)\n    ├── Dashboard.jsx           # Main video list & management\n    ├── Upload.jsx              # Video upload & analysis trigger\n    ├── ResultsEnhanced.jsx      # Enhanced results with video playback & skeleton overlay\n    ├── LivePractice.jsx        # Real-time pose detection (placeholder)\n    └── Results.jsx             # Legacy results page\n\n```\n\n**Component Types:**\n\n1. **Page Components** (handle full-page layouts):\n   - Login - Authentication form\n   - Dashboard - Video history with card grid\n   - Upload - File upload interface\n   - ResultsEnhanced - Video playback with annotations\n   - LivePractice - Real-time camera feed with pose detection\n\n2. **Context Providers**:\n   - AuthContext - User authentication state\n   - LanguageContext - i18n translations (3 languages)\n\n3. **UI Components**:\n   - LanguageSelector - Dropdown language switcher\n\n---\n\n### 5. UI Libraries\n\n**NO external UI libraries** (Shadcn/ui, Radix, Material-UI, etc.)\n\nAll components are built from scratch using:\n- HTML5 native elements (input, button, video, canvas)\n- Custom inline styles\n- React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext)\n\n---\n\n### 6. Global Styles & CSS Variables\n\n**Global CSS File**: `/src/index.css`\n\n**Key Global Styles:**\n```css\n:root {\n  font-family: system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n  color-scheme: light dark;\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87);\n  background-color: #242424;\n  font-synthesis: none;\n  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n}\n```\n\n**Media Queries**: Uses `prefers-color-scheme: light` for light mode support\n\n**No CSS Variables Defined** - All colors and spacing are hardcoded\n\n---\n\n### 7. Configuration Files Summary\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `package.json` | Dependencies and scripts |\n| `vite.config.js` | Vite + React plugin config |\n| `eslint.config.js` | Linting rules (flat config) |\n| `.env.example` | Template for environment variables |\n| `index.html` | Root HTML with #root div |\n\n---\n\n### 8. Internationalization (i18n)\n\n**Implemented via Context:**\n- **File**: `/src/context/LanguageContext.jsx`\n- **Languages**: English (en), Chinese (zh), Spanish (es)\n- **Translation Keys**: ~20 keys covering auth, dashboard, upload, results, and live practice\n- **Storage**: Saves language preference to localStorage\n- **Usage**: `useLanguage()` hook provides `t()` function for translations\n\n---\n\n### 9. State Management\n\n**Technology**: React Context API + useState\n\n**Contexts:**\n1. **AuthContext** - User authentication state, signUp, signIn, signOut methods\n2. **LanguageContext** - Current language and translation function\n\n**No Redux, Zustand, or other state management libraries**\n\n---\n\n### 10. Build & Development Setup\n\n**Scripts** (from package.json):\n```bash\nnpm run dev      # Start Vite dev server\nnpm run build    # Production build\nnpm run lint     # Run ESLint\nnpm run preview  # Preview production build\n```\n\n**Environment Variables**:\n- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL\n- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key\n- `VITE_BACKEND_URL` - Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:8000)\n\n---\n\n### 11. Styling Patterns Observed\n\n1. **Inline Styles Objects** - Each component exports a `styles` object\n2. **Flexbox & Grid Layouts** - For responsive design\n3. **Pseudo-selectors via JavaScript** - Using conditional styles with ternary operators\n4. **Color Coding**:\n   - Green backgrounds for success/primary actions\n   - Red for delete/danger\n   - Blue for secondary actions\n   - Yellow/orange for warnings\n   - Gray for disabled/secondary text\n\n5. **Dark Theme** - ResultsEnhanced uses dark mode (`backgroundColor: #1a1a1a`)\n\n---\n\n### 12. Notable Architectural Decisions\n\n- **No CSS Framework** - Pure CSS-in-JS approach provides full flexibility\n- **Monolithic Components** - Pages handle both layout and data fetching\n- **Protected Routes** - ProtectedRoute wrapper in App.jsx\n- **Supabase Integration** - Cloud authentication and real-time database\n- **Video Processing** - Backend handles pose detection and video annotation\n- **Canvas for Overlays** - ResultsEnhanced uses canvas for real-time overlays\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Aspect | Current State |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Framework** | React 19.2.0 + Vite |\n| **Styling** | Inline JavaScript objects only |\n| **UI Library** | None (custom components) |\n| **CSS Framework** | None |\n| **Design Tokens** | Hardcoded, not centralized |\n| **i18n** | Context API (en, zh, es) |\n| **State Management** | React Context + useState |\n| **Backend** | Supabase + FastAPI |\n| **Responsive** | Flexbox/Grid, no media queries |\n| **Build Tool** | Vite 7.2.4 |\n\nThis codebase is **lightweight, self-contained, and maintainable**, with all styling defined in code for flexibility.

I have both files. Now let me provide you with a detailed analysis of each page component.\n\n## DETAILED COMPONENT ANALYSIS\n\n---\n\n## 1. LOGIN.JSX (/frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx)\n\n### Overall Layout Structure\n- **Single container layout** with vertical centering\n- **Full viewport height** using `minHeight: '100vh'`\n- **Flexbox centering** both horizontally and vertically\n- **Centered card pattern** with `maxWidth: 400px`\n\n### Key UI Elements\n1. **Title & Subtitle** - Brand and mode indicator\n2. **Form Container** - Flex column layout with gap spacing\n3. **Input Fields** - Two inputs (email, password)\n4. **Error Message** - Conditional display for validation/auth errors\n5. **Primary Button** - Submit button with loading state\n6. **Toggle Link** - Mode switcher (Sign In ↔ Sign Up) as styled text link\n\n### Current Styling Approach\n```javascript\n// Inline styles object structure:\n- Uses hex colors (#333, #666, #4CAF50, red)\n- Hardcoded spacing: '2rem' padding, '0.75rem' input padding\n- Border radius: 8px for card, 4px for inputs/buttons\n- Box shadow: subtle 2px 10px with rgba opacity\n- Font sizing: relative ('1rem', '1.2rem')\n- Spacing gap: '1rem' for form elements\n```\n\n### State & Effects\n- **State management:**\n  - `email` - form input\n  - `password` - form input\n  - `isSignUp` - boolean toggle for form mode\n  - `error` - error message display\n  - `loading` - loading state during auth\n- **No useEffect hooks** - simple form component\n- **External dependencies:** `useAuth()` context, `useNavigate()` hook\n\n### Responsive Considerations\n- **Mobile-friendly:** Card uses `width: '100%'` with `maxWidth: '400px'`\n- **Flexbox for centering** works on all screen sizes\n- **No media queries** - relies on intrinsic responsive units\n- **Minimal at small viewports** - good for mobile\n\n---\n\n## 2. DASHBOARD.JSX (/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx)\n\n### Overall Layout Structure\n- **Full viewport container** with `minHeight: '100vh'`, `padding: '2rem'`\n- **Header section** - Sticky header with title and buttons\n- **Content section** - Main area with centered max-width (1200px)\n- **Grid system** - Auto-fill card grid layout (`repeat(auto-fill, minmax(350px, 1fr))`)\n\n### Key UI Elements\n1. **Header Section**\n   - Page title \"My Videos\"\n   -

`analyses` - array of video analyses\n  - `loading` - fetch state\n  - `error` - error message\n- **useEffect:** Fetches analyses when `user` changes\n- **External dependencies:** `supabase` client, `useAuth()` context, `useNavigate()` hook\n- **Data methods:**\n  - `fetchAnalyses()` - Queries Supabase with user filter\n  - `handleDelete()` - Removes analysis with confirmation\n  - `handleSignOut()` - Signs out and navigates\n  - `formatDate()` - Formats timestamps\n\n### Responsive Considerations\n- **Header:** `flexWrap: 'wrap'` allows buttons to stack on small screens\n- **Grid system:** Auto-fill responsive design - cards resize but maintain 350px minimum\n- **Max-width container:** Centers content and prevents excessive width\n- **Flexible spacing:** Gap-based layout\n- **No media queries** - relying on flexbox/grid responsiveness\n\n---\n\n## DESIGN SYSTEM MIGRATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n### High-Impact Changes Needed:\n\n#### 1. **Color System Refactoring**\n**Current:** Hardcoded hex values scattered throughout\n- Button colors vary: #4CAF50 (green), #FF9800 (orange), #2196F3 (blue), #f44336 (red)\n- Text colors: #333, #666, #999 (no semantic meaning)\n- Backgrounds: #f5f5f5, #f8f9fa, white\n\n**New system needs:**\n- Semantic tokens (primary, secondary, success, error, warning)\n- Centralized color palette\n- Theme-aware colors (light/dark mode support)\n\n#### 2. **Spacing & Typography**\n**Current:** Inconsistent hardcoded values\n- Padding: 2rem, 1.5rem, 1rem, 0.75rem, 0.5rem, 0.25rem\n- Font sizes: 1.2rem, 1.1rem, 1rem, 0.9rem, 0.85rem\n- Line heights: only previewText has explicit 1.4\n- No typography hierarchy system\n\n**New system needs:**\n- Scale system (xs, sm, base, lg, xl)\n- Typography scale (heading, body, caption, etc.)\n- Consistent line heights and letter spacing\n- Unified gap/margin/padding scale\n\n#### 3. **Component Styling Pattern**\n**Current issues:**\n- Inline styles objects defined at module level\n- Styles tightly coupled to component logic\n- No reusable button or input variants\n- No theme provider integration\n- Difficult to apply dynamic theming\n\n**New approach requires:**\n- Extract into styled components, CSS modules, or Tailwind\n- Create button variants (primary, secondary, danger, etc.)\n- Input wrapper component with consistent styling\n- Card component abstraction\n- Badge component for shot types\n\n#### 4. **Button Styles**\n**Current state:** 8 different button style definitions\n- `uploadButton`, `liveButton`, `signOutButton`, `viewButton`, `deleteButton`, `toggleButton`, `button` (Login)\n- Each has individual color, padding, border-radius definitions\n- No hover/active/disabled states defined\n\n**New system needs:**\n- Button component with variants (primary, secondary, danger, tertiary)\n- Consistent states: default, hover, active, disabled, loading\n- Icon support for emoji removal\n- Size variants\n\n#### 5. **Card & Container Styling**\n**Current:** Two similar card styles with shadow but no variant system\n- Login card vs Dashboard card - redundant styling\n- No elevation system\n- Shadow values hardcoded\n\n**New approach:**\n- Card component with elevation levels\n- Re-usable container wrapper\n- Consistent border radius tokens\n\n#### 6. **Form Elements**\n**Current:** Single input style with hardcoded border, padding, fontSize\n- No focus states\n- No error styling\n- No disabled state styling\n- Placeholder styling not customized\n\n**New system needs:**\n- Input component with validation states\n- Focus/error/disabled styles\n- Consistent placeholder styling\n- Label component abstraction\n\n#### 7. **State-Based Styling**\n**Current:** Minimal - only basic conditional styles\n- Shot badges use inline conditional for background color\n- Error message is plain red text\n- Loading state has no visual indication (only text)\n\n**New system needs:**\n- Loading skeleton components\n- Error boundary with consistent styling\n- Toast/notification components\n- Success/warning/info visual states\n\n#### 8. **Responsive Breakpoints**\n**Current:** No media queries - relying on flexbox/grid\n- Works but lacks refinement at different sizes\n- Header buttons may not stack optimally on very small screens\n- Grid gap might be too large on mobile\n\n**New system needs:**\n- Define breakpoint tokens (mobile, tablet, desktop)\n- Responsive padding/spacing scale\n- Conditional font sizes for mobile\n\n#### 9. **Accessibility**\n**Current:** Missing WCAG considerations\n- No focus indicators for buttons\n- Contrast not validated\n- No aria labels\n- Color-only information (shot badges)\n\n**New system needs:**\n- Focus states for keyboard navigation\n- Contrast ratio compliance\n- Semantic HTML and ARIA labels\n- Color + icon indication for badges\n\n---\n\n## MIGRATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\n\n### Phase 1: Create Design Tokens\n- Extract colors, spacing, typography into token system\n- Define component sizing scale\n- Shadow/elevation definitions\n\n### Phase 2: Component Abstraction\n- Create Button component with variants\n- Create Input/Form component\n- Create Card/Container components\n- Create Badge component\n\n### Phase 3: Global Theming\n- Implement theme provider (if using CSS-in-JS)\n- Support light/dark mode\n- Apply tokens throughout\n\n### Phase 4: Refactor Pages\n- Replace inline styles in Login.jsx\n- Replace inline styles in Dashboard.jsx\n- Add responsive variants\n- Add state-based styling\n\n### Phase 5: Polish & Testing\n- Add hover/focus states\n- Verify responsive behavior\n- Accessibility audit\n- Performance optimization\n\n---\n\n## KEY FILES TO IMPACT\n\n1. **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\pages\\Login.jsx** -

Full-width video section\n  2. Two-column grid below (shot timeline + AI report)\n\n**Key UI Elements:**\n\n*Video Section:*\n- Video player with native controls (HTML5 `<video>`)\n- Absolute positioned overlay showing current shot info\n- Real-time frame counter\n- Ghost mode checkbox\n- Video error/warning states\n\n*Left Column (Shot Timeline):*\n- Scrollable list of detected shots\n- Click-to-jump functionality\n- Shows shot type, frame number, suggestion\n- Interactive items with hover effect\n\n*Right Column (AI Report):*\n- Technique analysis text\n- Training plan (handles string or array formats)\n- H3 subheadings with spacing\n\n**Current Styling Approach:**\n- Dark theme: #1a1a1a background, #2d2d2d cards\n- Accent color: green (#4CAF50)\n- Inline styles throughout\n- Emphasis on readability with borders and spacing\n- Overlay uses semi-transparent black (rgba(0,0,0,0.8))\n- Grid layout for bottom two sections\n\n**State & Effects Being Used:**\n- `location.state` - receives analysis data from previous page\n- `videoRef` - for video element control\n- `currentFrame` - tracks playback position (calculated from video time)\n- `showGhost` - boolean toggle for ghost comparison feature\n- `videoError` - error state management\n- `handleTimeUpdate` - syncs video time to frame counter (assumes 30fps)\n- `jumpToFrame` - seeks video and auto-plays\n\n**Complex Interactions:**\n1. **Video-Frame Sync:** Video's `onTimeUpdate` → calculate current frame → find matching shot\n2. **Shot Matching:** `currentShot` finder uses ±15 frame tolerance\n3. **Interactive Timeline:** Shot items clickable → seeks to frame → auto-plays\n4. **Conditional Rendering:** Overlay only shows when shot is in frame window\n5. **Data Fallback:** Handles both `gemini_feedback` and legacy `feedback` fields\n\n---\n\n## CHANGES NEEDED FOR NEW DESIGN SYSTEM\n\n### **Structure & Components**\n| Element | Current | Design System Integration |\n|---------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Colors | Hardcoded hex (#4CAF50, #1a1a1a) | → Theme tokens/design tokens system |\n| Spacing | Magic numbers (2rem, 10px, 20px) | → Spacing scale (sm, md, lg, xl) |\n| Typography | Limited text styling | → Typography system (heading levels, sizes) |\n| Shadows | Basic hardcoded | → Shadow system/elevation scale |\n| Border Radius | Hardcoded 4px, 8px | → Radius scale |\n| Buttons | Inline styled divs | → Reusable Button component |\n| Cards | Inline styled divs | → Reusable Card component |\n| Video Player | Native HTML5 + overlay | → Wrapped in Player component with design styling |\n| Forms | Raw file input | → Wrapped Input component |\n| Lists | Raw divs with inline styles | → List/Timeline component |\n\n### **Specific Changes Required**\n\n**Upload.jsx:**\n1. Extract button styles → `<Button>` component (with variants for primary/danger)\n2. Extract card → `<Card>` component\n3. Extract file input → `<FileInput>` component with better UX\n4. Replace color strings with theme tokens: `styles.button.backgroundColor` → `theme.colors.primary`\n5. Replace padding/margin numbers with spacing tokens\n6. Add new button states (hover, active, disabled) from design system\n7. Update sign-out button to use red/danger variant from design system\n\n**ResultsEnhanced.jsx:**\n1. Extract video player → `<VideoPlayer>` component with overlay built-in\n2. Extract shot overlay → `<ShotOverlay>` component\n3. Extract shot list items → `<ShotListItem>` component\n4. Extract report section → `<CoachReport>` component\n5. Create `<Layout>` component for header + content structure\n6. Replace color tokens throughout (dark #1a1a1a → `theme.colors.background`)\n7. Replace grid setup with design system grid/layout helpers\n8. Update error states to use design system alert/warning components\n9. Normalize all spacing to token scale\n10. Add typography tokens for h1, h2, p, span elements\n11.

Let me provide you with a comprehensive analysis.\n\n## DETAILED ANALYSIS OF PAGE COMPONENTS\n\n### 1. **UPLOAD.JSX** - File Upload Interface\n\n**Overall Layout Structure:**\n- Root container with centered card layout\n- Header section with title and auth controls\n- Single centered card (max-width: 600px) containing form\n- All content vertically stacked\n\n**Key UI Elements:**\n- Header with title and conditional sign-out button\n- File input with video mime-type filter\n- Selected filename display (conditional)\n- Progress text indicator (conditional)\n- Submit button with disabled state\n\n**Current Styling Approach:**\n- Inline styles object at bottom of file (lines 116-184)\n- Simple color palette: grays (#333, #666, #ddd), white, green (#4CAF50), red (#f44336), blue (#2196F3)\n- Light theme (light gray background #f5f5f5)\n- Basic shadows (0 2px 10px rgba)\n- Dashed border for file input\n\n**State Management:**\n- `videoFile` - stores selected File object\n- `uploading` - boolean flag for upload state\n- `progress` - string for status messages\n- `user` - from AuthContext\n- Button state tied to file selection\n\n**State Flow:**\n```\nNo file → File selected → Analyzing → Complete → Navigation\n(button disabled) → (button enabled) → (button disabled) → (to /results)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **RESULTSENHANCED.JSX** - Video Playback & Analysis Results\n\n**Overall Layout Structure:**\n- Dark theme container (full height)\n- Header with title and back button\n- Content wrapper with flexbox column layout\n- Three-section vertical layout:\n  1. Full-width video section\n  2. Two-column grid below (shot timeline + AI report)\n\n**Key UI Elements:**\n\n*Video Section:*\n- Video player with native controls (HTML5 `<video>`)\n- Absolute positioned overlay showing current shot info\n- Real-time frame counter\n- Ghost mode checkbox\n- Video error/warning states\n\n*Left Column (Shot Timeline):*\n- Scrollable list of detected shots\n- Click-to-jump functionality\n- Shows shot type, frame number, suggestion\n- Interactive items with hover effect\n\n*Right Column (AI Report):*\n- Technique analysis text\n- Training plan (handles string or array formats)\n- H3 subheadings with spacing\n\n**Current Styling Approach:**\n- Dark theme: #1a1a1a background, #2d2d2d cards\n- Accent color: green (#4CAF50)\n- Inline styles throughout\n- Emphasis on readability with borders and spacing\n- Overlay uses semi-transparent black (rgba(0,0,0,0.8))\n- Grid layout for bottom two sections\n\n**State & Effects Being Used:**\n- `location.state` - receives analysis data from previous page\n- `videoRef` - for video element control\n- `currentFrame` - tracks playback position (calculated from video time)\n- `showGhost` - boolean toggle for ghost comparison feature\n- `videoError` - error state management\n- `handleTimeUpdate` - syncs video time to frame counter (assumes 30fps)\n- `jumpToFrame` - seeks video and auto-plays\n\n**Complex Interactions:**\n1. **Video-Frame Sync:** Video's `onTimeUpdate` → calculate current frame → find matching shot\n2. **Shot Matching:** `currentShot` finder uses ±15 frame tolerance\n3. **Interactive Timeline:** Shot items clickable → seeks to frame → auto-plays\n4. **Conditional Rendering:** Overlay only shows when shot is in frame window\n5. **Data Fallback:** Handles both `gemini_feedback` and legacy `feedback` fields\n\n---\n\n## CHANGES NEEDED FOR NEW DESIGN SYSTEM\n\n### **Structure & Components**\n| Element | Current | Design System Integration |\n|---------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Colors | Hardcoded hex (#4CAF50, #1a1a1a) | → Theme tokens/design tokens system |\n| Spacing | Magic numbers (2rem, 10px, 20px) | → Spacing scale (sm, md, lg, xl) |\n| Typography | Limited text styling | → Typography system (heading levels, sizes) |\n| Shadows | Basic hardcoded | → Shadow system/elevation scale |\n| Border Radius | Hardcoded 4px, 8px | → Radius scale |\n| Buttons | Inline styled divs | → Reusable Button component |\n| Cards | Inline styled divs | → Reusable Card component |\n| Video Player | Native HTML5 + overlay | → Wrapped in Player component with design styling |\n| Forms | Raw file input | → Wrapped Input component |\n| Lists | Raw divs with inline styles | → List/Timeline component |\n\n### **Specific Changes Required**\n\n**Upload.jsx:**\n1. Extract button styles → `<Button>` component (with variants for primary/danger)\n2. Extract card → `<Card>` component\n3. Extract file input → `<FileInput>` component with better UX\n4. Replace color strings with theme tokens: `styles.button.backgroundColor` → `theme.colors.primary`\n5. Replace padding/margin numbers with spacing tokens\n6. Add new button states (hover, active, disabled) from design system\n7. Update sign-out button to use red/danger variant from design system\n\n**ResultsEnhanced.jsx:**\n1. Extract video player → `<VideoPlayer>` component with overlay built-in\n2. Extract shot overlay → `<ShotOverlay>` component\n3. Extract shot list items → `<ShotListItem>` component\n4. Extract report section → `<CoachReport>` component\n5. Create `<Layout>` component for header + content structure\n6. Replace color tokens throughout (dark #1a1a1a → `theme.colors.background`)\n7. Replace grid setup with design system grid/layout helpers\n8. Update error states to use design system alert/warning components\n9. Normalize all spacing to token scale\n10. Add typography tokens for h1, h2, p, span elements\n11.

The file should include:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n/* ========================================\n   CLAYMORPHISM DESIGN TOKENS\n   ======================================== */\n\n@theme {\n  /* Canvas & Background */\n  --color-canvas: #F4F1FA;\n  --color-canvas-dark: #E8E4F0;\n  \n  /* Text Colors */\n  --color-text-primary: #332F3A;\n  --color-text-muted: #635F69;\n  --color-text-light: #9D99A5;\n  \n  /* Accent Colors */\n  --color-accent-violet: #7C3AED;\n  --color-accent-violet-light: #A78BFA;\n  --color-accent-violet-dark: #5B21B6;\n  --color-accent-pink: #DB2777;\n  --color-accent-pink-light: #F472B6;\n  --color-accent-blue: #0EA5E9;\n  --color-accent-blue-light: #38BDF8;\n  --color-accent-green: #10B981;\n  --color-accent-green-light: #34D399;\n  \n  /* Status Colors */\n  --color-success: #10B981;\n  --color-warning: #F59E0B;\n  --color-error: #EF4444;\n  --color-info: #0EA5E9;\n  \n  /* Border Radius (Claymorphism = Super Rounded) */\n  --radius-sm: 12px;\n  --radius-md: 20px;\n  --radius-lg: 28px;\n  --radius-xl: 32px;\n  --radius-2xl: 40px;\n  --radius-full: 9999px;\n  \n  /* Font Families */\n  --font-display: 'Nunito', system-ui, sans-serif;\n  --font-body: 'DM Sans', system-ui, sans-serif;\n  \n  /* Font Weights */\n  --font-weight-normal: 400;\n  --font-weight-medium: 500;\n  --font-weight-semibold: 600;\n  --font-weight-bold: 700;\n  --font-weight-extrabold: 800;\n  --font-weight-black: 900;\n  \n  /* Shadow Stacks (4-layer Claymorphism) */\n  --shadow-clay-card: \n    0 2px 4px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.04),\n    0 4px 8px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.06),\n    0 8px 16px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.08),\n    0 16px 32px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.10);\n  \n  --shadow-clay-card-hover: \n    0 4px 8px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.06),\n    0 8px 16px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.08),\n    0 16px 32px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.12),\n    0 24px 48px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.14);\n  \n  --shadow-clay-button: \n    0 2px 4px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.08),\n    0 4px 8px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.12),\n    0 8px 16px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.08),\n    inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);\n  \n  --shadow-clay-pressed: \n    0 1px 2px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.12),\n    inset 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n  \n  --shadow-clay-input: \n    inset 0 2px 4px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.06),\n    0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);\n  \n  /* Transition Durations */\n  --duration-fast: 150ms;\n  --duration-normal: 250ms;\n  --duration-slow: 400ms;\n  \n  /* Animation Easings */\n  --ease-bounce: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);\n  --ease-smooth: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);\n}\n\n/* Base Layer Resets */\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply font-body;\n  }\n  \n  html {\n    @apply bg-canvas text-text-primary antialiased;\n  }\n  \n  body {\n    @apply min-h-screen;\n  }\n  \n  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n    @apply font-display font-bold;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 1.4: Add Google Fonts to index.html\n\n**File to modify:**\n- `c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\index.html`\n\n**Add to `<head>`:**\n```html\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\n<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Sans:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Nunito:wght@700;800;900&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<title>RallyCoach -

Render in isolation\n2. Test all variant props\n3. Test all size props\n4. Test hover states\n5. Test active/pressed states\n6. Test disabled states\n7. Verify shadow stacks render correctly\n\n### Step 5.2: Page-by-Page Testing\n\n**Login:**\n- [ ] Form submission works\n- [ ] Error messages display\n- [ ] Toggle between Sign In/Sign Up\n- [ ] Navigation to Dashboard on success\n- [ ] Floating blobs animate\n\n**Upload:**\n- [ ] File selection works\n- [ ] Progress displays during upload\n- [ ] API call to backend succeeds\n- [ ] Navigation to Results with state\n\n**Dashboard:**\n- [ ] Analyses load from Supabase\n- [ ] Delete functionality works\n- [ ] Navigation to Upload works\n- [ ] Navigation to Live Practice works\n- [ ] Navigation to Results with analysis data\n- [ ] Card grid responsive\n\n**LivePractice:**\n- [ ] Camera starts when button clicked\n- [ ] Camera stops when stopped\n- [ ] Drill selection changes state\n- [ ] Canvas overlay renders\n- [ ] All refs work correctly\n\n**ResultsEnhanced:**\n- [ ] Video loads and plays\n- [ ] Frame counter updates on timeUpdate\n- [ ] Shot overlay appears at correct frames\n- [ ] Timeline items jump to correct time\n- [ ] Gemini feedback displays\n- [ ] Ghost toggle state works\n- [ ] Error states display when video fails\n\n### Step 5.3: Cross-Browser Testing\n\n- [ ] Chrome (latest)\n- [ ] Firefox (latest)\n- [ ] Safari (latest)\n- [ ] Edge (latest)\n\n### Step 5.4: Responsive Testing\n\n- [ ] Mobile (320px - 480px)\n- [ ] Tablet (768px - 1024px)\n- [ ] Desktop (1280px+)\n\n### Step 5.5: Performance Verification\n\n- [ ] Tailwind purges unused classes in production build\n- [ ] Blob animations don't cause layout thrashing\n- [ ] Page transitions smooth\n- [ ] Video playback unaffected by styling\n\n---\n\n## File Summary\n\n### New Files to Create:\n1. `src/components/ui/Button.jsx`\n2. `src/components/ui/Card.jsx`\n3. `src/components/ui/Input.jsx`\n4. `src/components/ui/Badge.jsx`\n5. `src/components/ui/Progress.jsx`\n6. `src/components/ui/index.js`\n7. `src/components/layout/PageContainer.jsx`\n8. `src/components/layout/Header.jsx`\n9. `src/components/layout/FloatingBlobs.jsx`\n10. `src/components/layout/index.js`\n\n### Files to Modify:\n1. `package.json` - Add Tailwind dependencies\n2. `vite.config.js` - Add Tailwind plugin\n3. `index.html` - Add Google Fonts\n4. `src/index.css` - Replace with Tailwind + design tokens\n5. `src/pages/Login.jsx` - Full redesign\n6. `src/pages/Upload.jsx` - Full redesign\n7. `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Full redesign\n8. `src/pages/LivePractice.jsx` - Full redesign (preserve refs/camera)\n9. `src/pages/ResultsEnhanced.jsx` - Full redesign (preserve video/canvas)\n10. `src/components/LanguageSelector.jsx` - Convert to Tailwind\n11. `src/App.jsx` - Update loading state styling\n\n### Files to Delete (after migration):\n1. `src/App.css` - Vite boilerplate no longer needed\n\n---\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **VideoRef/CanvasRef Breaking**: Before modifying ResultsEnhanced or LivePractice, extract all ref-related code and video handlers into a backup. These must remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Supabase Integration**: The auth and database calls in AuthContext and Dashboard use environment variables. Ensure these remain accessible after Tailwind setup.\n\n3. **i18n Integration**: The LanguageContext is not currently used in pages but exists. Ensure component redesigns can accept translated text props.\n\n4. **Incremental Migration**: Consider keeping old styles temporarily and migrating page-by-page, removing inline styles only after the Tailwind version is verified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\index.css** - Core file for Tailwind v4 design token configuration; all custom colors, shadows, and animations defined here\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\vite.config.js** - Must be modified to add Tailwind v4 Vite plugin for build pipeline\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\pages\\ResultsEnhanced.jsx** - Most complex page with video/canvas refs; requires careful preservation of videoRef, onTimeUpdate, and overlay positioning\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\pages\\LivePractice.jsx** - Contains camera stream handling with videoRef/canvasRef that must be preserved during redesign\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\context\\AuthContext.jsx** - Reference for auth integration pattern; all pages must continue using useAuth hook correctly"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a6631a5 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"341d6a07-2823-4966-9ee9-9a9d901ee363","timestamp":"2026-01-17T22:38:21.302Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Design a detailed implementation plan for integrating a High-Fidelity Claymorphism design system into a React + Vite application.\n\n**Current State:**\n- React 19.2.0 + Vite 7.2.4\n- NO Tailwind currently (will be added)\n- All styling via inline JS objects\n- 5 pages: Login, Dashboard, Upload, ResultsEnhanced, LivePractice\n- No shared UI components\n- Material Design colors (greens, blues, small radii)\n\n**Target State (Claymorphism Design System):**\n- Canvas background: #F4F1FA\n- Text: #332F3A (primary), #635F69 (muted)\n- Accents: #7C3AED (violet), #DB2777 (pink), #0EA5E9 (blue), #10B981 (green)\n- Super-rounded corners: minimum rounded-[20px], cards rounded-[32px]\n- 4-layer shadow stacks for depth (clayCard, clayButton, clayPressed)\n- Fonts: Nunito (headings, 700-900 weight) + DM Sans (body)\n- Floating animated blobs in background\n- Interactive states: hover lift (-translate-y-1/2), active squish (scale-[0.92])\n- Glass-clay hybrid cards (bg-white/60 + backdrop-blur-xl)\n\n**Pages to redesign:**\n1.

The dark theme in current implementation should be converted to light claymorphism with a dark Card variant for video section if desired\n5. Preserve `aspectRatio: '16/9'` on video container\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Additional Styling Updates\n\n### Step 4.1: Update LanguageSelector Component\n\n**File to modify:** `c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\components\\LanguageSelector.jsx`\n\nConvert inline styles to Tailwind classes matching the design system.\n\n### Step 4.2: Update App.jsx Loading State\n\n**File to modify:** `c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\App.jsx`\n\nThe `ProtectedRoute` loading div should use Tailwind classes.\n\n### Step 4.3: Clean Up Legacy CSS Files\n\n**Files to modify/remove:**\n- `c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\App.css` - Remove after migration (currently has Vite boilerplate)\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Verification Steps\n\n### Step 5.1: Component Library Testing\n\nFor each component:\n1. Render in isolation\n2. Test all variant props\n3. Test all size props\n4. Test hover states\n5. Test active/pressed states\n6. Test disabled states\n7. Verify shadow stacks render correctly\n\n### Step 5.2: Page-by-Page Testing\n\n**Login:**\n- [ ] Form submission works\n- [ ] Error messages display\n- [ ] Toggle between Sign In/Sign Up\n- [ ] Navigation to Dashboard on success\n- [ ] Floating blobs animate\n\n**Upload:**\n- [ ] File selection works\n- [ ] Progress displays during upload\n- [ ] API call to backend succeeds\n- [ ] Navigation to Results with state\n\n**Dashboard:**\n- [ ] Analyses load from Supabase\n- [ ] Delete functionality works\n- [ ] Navigation to Upload works\n- [ ] Navigation to Live Practice works\n- [ ] Navigation to Results with analysis data\n- [ ] Card grid responsive\n\n**LivePractice:**\n- [ ] Camera starts when button clicked\n- [ ] Camera stops when stopped\n- [ ] Drill selection changes state\n- [ ] Canvas overlay renders\n- [ ] All refs work correctly\n\n**ResultsEnhanced:**\n- [ ] Video loads and plays\n- [ ] Frame counter updates on timeUpdate\n- [ ] Shot overlay appears at correct frames\n- [ ] Timeline items jump to correct time\n- [ ] Gemini feedback displays\n- [ ] Ghost toggle state works\n- [ ] Error states display when video fails\n\n### Step 5.3: Cross-Browser Testing\n\n- [ ] Chrome (latest)\n- [ ] Firefox (latest)\n- [ ] Safari (latest)\n- [ ] Edge (latest)\n\n### Step 5.4: Responsive Testing\n\n- [ ] Mobile (320px - 480px)\n- [ ] Tablet (768px - 1024px)\n- [ ] Desktop (1280px+)\n\n### Step 5.5: Performance Verification\n\n- [ ] Tailwind purges unused classes in production build\n- [ ] Blob animations don't cause layout thrashing\n- [ ] Page transitions smooth\n- [ ] Video playback unaffected by styling\n\n---\n\n## File Summary\n\n### New Files to Create:\n1. `src/components/ui/Button.jsx`\n2. `src/components/ui/Card.jsx`\n3. `src/components/ui/Input.jsx`\n4. `src/components/ui/Badge.jsx`\n5. `src/components/ui/Progress.jsx`\n6. `src/components/ui/index.js`\n7. `src/components/layout/PageContainer.jsx`\n8. `src/components/layout/Header.jsx`\n9. `src/components/layout/FloatingBlobs.jsx`\n10. `src/components/layout/index.js`\n\n### Files to Modify:\n1. `package.json` - Add Tailwind dependencies\n2. `vite.config.js` - Add Tailwind plugin\n3. `index.html` - Add Google Fonts\n4. `src/index.css` - Replace with Tailwind + design tokens\n5. `src/pages/Login.jsx` - Full redesign\n6. `src/pages/Upload.jsx` - Full redesign\n7. `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Full redesign\n8. `src/pages/LivePractice.jsx` - Full redesign (preserve refs/camera)\n9. `src/pages/ResultsEnhanced.jsx` - Full redesign (preserve video/canvas)\n10. `src/components/LanguageSelector.jsx` - Convert to Tailwind\n11. `src/App.jsx` - Update loading state styling\n\n### Files to Delete (after migration):\n1. `src/App.css` - Vite boilerplate no longer needed\n\n---\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **VideoRef/CanvasRef Breaking**: Before modifying ResultsEnhanced or LivePractice, extract all ref-related code and video handlers into a backup. These must remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Supabase Integration**: The auth and database calls in AuthContext and Dashboard use environment variables. Ensure these remain accessible after Tailwind setup.\n\n3. **i18n Integration**: The LanguageContext is not currently used in pages but exists. Ensure component redesigns can accept translated text props.\n\n4. **Incremental Migration**: Consider keeping old styles temporarily and migrating page-by-page, removing inline styles only after the Tailwind version is verified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\index.css** - Core file for Tailwind v4 design token configuration; all custom colors, shadows, and animations defined here\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\vite.config.js** - Must be modified to add Tailwind v4 Vite plugin for build pipeline\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\pages\\ResultsEnhanced.jsx** - Most complex page with video/canvas refs; requires careful preservation of videoRef, onTimeUpdate, and overlay positioning\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\pages\\LivePractice.jsx** - Contains camera stream handling with videoRef/canvasRef that must be preserved during redesign\n- **c:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Gemini 3 hack\\frontend\\src\\context\\AuthContext.jsx** - Reference for auth integration pattern; all pages must continue using useAuth hook correctly"}],"totalDurationMs":202011,"totalTokens":44606,"totalToolUseCount":26,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4798,"cache_read_input_tokens":39805,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4798,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"773bcba4-6570-41dc-8b16-d79319039d6a"}
