User showed a screenshot of a CData Connect AI OAuth \"Callback URL mismatch\" error\n2. User asked to \"fix this\"\n3. I explained that this is an OAuth configuration issue that needs to be fixed in CData's dashboard, not in their code\n4. User then said \"do change anything\" - which I interpreted as \"don't change anything\"\n5. I gave them instructions on how to fix it in CData's dashboard\n\nThe error is a configuration issue with a third-party service (CData Connect AI), not something in their code. The user's project doesn't even use CData - it uses Supabase and Gemini.\n\nGiven this situation:\n- The user can't fix this through code changes\n- I've explained the fix is in CData's dashboard\n- The user might not even know why they're seeing this error (could be a browser thing, or they were trying to set up a new integration)\n\nThe next step isn't obvious. The user would need to clarify:\n- What they're trying to integrate with CData\n- Or realize this isn't related to their project\n\nI should stay silent here as the next step isn't clear from what the user said. They might need to assess the situation or provide more context.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":869,"cache_read_input_tokens":38872,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":869},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXcdQXMCkqePDnc2scH1N","type":"assistant","uuid":"06681481-c457-4463-942e-2e244d57c6bc","timestamp":"2026-01-30T00:38:04.102Z"}
