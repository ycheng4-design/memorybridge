Now Claude is asking another clarifying question about where the processing should run (backend vs frontend vs hybrid).\n\nGiven the context:\n- User wants a robust, production-grade implementation\n- They're refactoring a complex CV pipeline\n- The user chose the more sophisticated YOLO+ByteTrack option over simpler alternatives\n- Backend (Python) was marked as \"Recommended\" and mentions GPU acceleration, no browser limitations\n\nThe user would likely select the recommended option again, especially since:\n1. They already have a Python FastAPI backend\n2. YOLO + ByteTrack are Python-native tools\n3. Heavy CV processing is more suited for backend\n\nThey'd probably type \"1\" to select backend processing.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":719,"cache_read_input_tokens":142263,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":719},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXeSLFmwq5g7JrLtL39yR","type":"assistant","uuid":"7a72b7b1-3a12-4da0-a625-349f7eef90c8","timestamp":"2026-01-30T23:34:03.268Z"}
