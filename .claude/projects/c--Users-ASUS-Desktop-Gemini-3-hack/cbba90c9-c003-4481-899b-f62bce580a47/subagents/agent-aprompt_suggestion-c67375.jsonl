The current question offers 3 options:\n1. Contextual phase labels with timing cues\n2. Cause-and-effect annotations\n3. Both combined (Recommended)\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n- First question: chose option 2 (not the recommended option 1)\n- Second question: chose option 1 (the recommended option)\n- Third question: chose option 1 (the recommended option)\n- Fourth question: chose option 1 (the recommended option)\n\nThe user seems to generally go with reasonable options, and option 3 here is marked as \"(Recommended)\" which combines both approaches. They might go with 3 for the complete experience, or they might stick with their pattern of choosing simpler focused options.\n\nGiven they've been picking \"1\" frequently lately (3 times in a row), they might continue that pattern. But option 3 is the recommended one and provides the most complete solution.\n\nI'll suggest \"3\" as they seem to want the full-featured solution given their other choices (full YOLO+ByteTrack, backend processing, React Three Fiber).","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":795,"cache_read_input_tokens":143704,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":795},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXeSZEKzSJ2E83yfoZU44","type":"assistant","uuid":"387d480f-58f1-4320-8085-69f0bdea8482","timestamp":"2026-01-30T23:37:01.790Z"}
