They've now added 8 skills in total. The last few came from the anthropics/skills repo which has 17 skills.\n\nThe user might:\n1. Add another skill from another repo\n2. List their installed skills\n3. Start using one of the skills they installed\n4. Do something else entirely\n\nGiven the pattern, they might continue adding more skills, or they might want to see what they have installed, or start a new project using these skills. But I can't be certain what they'd type next - this could be the end of their skill installation session.\n\nLooking at the user's style - they've been copy-pasting `npx skills add...` commands. They might have more to add, or they might be done.\n\nThis feels like a natural stopping point where the user might either:\n- Add more skills (but I don't know which one)\n- List installed skills: `npx skills list`\n- Start a new project\n\nSince I can't predict which specific skill they'd add next (if any), and the task seems complete, staying silent might be appropriate. But if they want to verify what they installed, they might type `npx skills list`.\n\nGiven the pattern of just installing skills, they might want to see what they have now.
