Looking at the pattern, they've been adding skills from various repositories. The last few were from anthropics/skills (frontend-design, skill-creator, mcp-builder).\n\nThe user might want to:\n1. Continue installing more skills\n2. List all installed skills\n3. Start using the skills they've installed\n\nGiven the pattern of the user consistently adding skills, and that they've just finished adding the 14th skill, they might want to:\n- Add more skills\n- Check what skills they have\n- Start a new project using these skills\n\nBut I don't have enough context to predict exactly which skill or command they would type next. The pattern has been them giving specific npx skills add commands.\n\nSince I can't predict the exact skill they want to add next, and there's no obvious follow-up from what they've been doing, I should stay silent or suggest something like listing skills.\n\nActually, they might want to verify all skills are installed, or start using them. A reasonable suggestion might be \"npx skills list\" to see all installed skills, or they might be done and want to start building something.\n\nGiven the context - they've installed many UI/design related skills - they might want to start a project.
