Looking at the context, this seems to be related to a \"Gemini 3 hack\" project based on the working directory.\n\nThe user ran a command to add a skill. Now that it's installed, what would they naturally want to do next?\n\nSome possibilities:\n- They might want to see what the skill does\n- They might want to use the skill\n- They might want to continue with their project\n\nSince they just installed a \"vercel-react-best-practices\" skill, they're likely working on some React project and want to either:\n1. Use the skill to check/improve their code\n2. Start building something\n\nBut I don't have enough context about what they're building. The skill is now available, so they might want to invoke it or continue with whatever they were doing before.\n\nActually, looking at the directory name \"Gemini 3 hack\", this seems like a hackathon project. They just added this skill presumably to help with their React development.\n\nThe most natural next step after installing a tool/skill would be to use it or to continue building their project. But without knowing what their project is, it's hard to predict.\n\nThey might type something like:\n- \"what does this skill do\"\n- Start building their project\n- Use the skill\n\nActually, thinking about it more - after installing a new skill, a very natural thing would be to see what it can do or how to use it. Or they might just continue with building their project.\n\nGiven the hackathon context (\"Gemini 3 hack\"), they're probably eager to build something. They might want to:\n- Create a new React app\n- Use the skill on existing code\n- Start their project\n\nBut I'm not confident enough about what they'd naturally type next. The installation is complete, and the next step really depends on what they're trying to build, which I don't have context on.\n\nI think I should stay silent here because the next step isn't obvious from what the user said - they just installed a skill but haven't indicated what they're building or want to do next.\n","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":445,"cache_read_input_tokens":25842,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":445},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXccJ6zTJmKZzg91TfQ5F","type":"assistant","uuid":"f2722bfe-c116-4871-9680-a55fe580b89e","timestamp":"2026-01-30T00:23:36.329Z"}
