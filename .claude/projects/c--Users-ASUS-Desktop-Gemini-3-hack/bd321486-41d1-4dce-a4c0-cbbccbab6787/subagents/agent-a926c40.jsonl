Your job is to tear apart the following demo video script for a Google hackathon, finding every weakness, gap, and missed opportunity. You must be ruthlessly honest. Remember: you're competing against hundreds of other hackathon submissions — being \"good enough\" loses.\n\nThe judging criteria are:\n- Technical Execution (40%): Does the project demonstrate quality application development? Does it leverage Google Gemini 3? Is the code of good quality and is it functional?\n- Innovation / Wow Factor (30%): How novel and original is the idea? Does it address a significant problem or create a unique solution?\n- Potential Impact (20%): How big of an impact could the project have in the real world? How useful is the project to a broad market of users?\n- Presentation / Demo (10%): Is the problem clearly defined, and is the solution effectively presented through a demo and documentation?\n\nThe script is for a UNDER 3-MINUTE demonstration video for RallyCoach — an AI badminton coaching app that uses Gemini 3 (Flash, Pro, Pro Image), MediaPipe, Three.js, Supabase, and Next.js 14.\n\nHere is the script:\n\n---\n\n## [0:00–0:15] THE HOOK — The Problem (15 seconds)\n[SCREEN: Dramatic slow-motion of a player shanking a badminton clear into the net]\nNARRATOR: \"Badminton is the second most-played sport on Earth — 300 million players worldwide. Yet 99% of them have never had a single coaching session. They record shaky phone videos, squint at their form, and hope they're improving.\"\n[SCREEN: Quick montage — phone recording, confused player reviewing footage, YouTube tutorial]\n\"What if you didn't need a coach standing behind you? What if your webcam was the coach — and it could react in under 500 milliseconds?\"\n\n## [0:15–0:30] THE REVEAL — Introducing RallyCoach (15 seconds)\n[SCREEN: RallyCoach landing page loads — dark premium UI with the tagline]\nNARRATOR: \"This is RallyCoach — a full-stack AI coaching platform that turns any browser into a personal badminton coach. No sensors. No wearables. No expensive equipment. Just you, your racket, and Google Gemini 3.\"\n[SCREEN: Quick flash of the architecture diagram showing the pipeline]\n\"Webcam to MediaPipe to Gemini 3 Flash — coaching in under half a second.\"\n\n## [0:30–1:15] CORE DEMO — Real-Time Practice Mode (45 seconds)\n[SCREEN: Click \"Practice Mode\" — webcam activates, skeleton overlay appears]\nNARRATOR: \"Here's where it gets real. MediaPipe runs entirely in your browser as WebAssembly — extracting 33 body landmarks at 30 frames per second with zero server load.\"\n[SCREEN: Player moves — skeleton turns GREEN, then RED as elbow drops]\n\"See that? The skeleton just turned red. Our local rules engine evaluated five biomechanical rules — elbow angle, knee bend, stance width, body rotation — and caught a dropped elbow instantly.\"\n[SCREEN: Zoom into the coaching cue overlay showing: \"Elbow higher on backswing\" with commentary and reasoning]\n\"But here's what makes RallyCoach different from any pose app. Every one to two seconds, Gemini 3 Flash receives the live pose metrics and returns structured coaching — not just what to fix, but why.\"\n[SCREEN: Highlight the AI Insights sidebar — show commentary, reasoning, and latency badge showing \"340ms\"]\n\"Look at this: 'Your elbow is dropping to 128 degrees — you're losing 30% of your smash power.' And the reasoning: 'elbow angle 128 degrees is below the 150 degree threshold for overhead shots, reducing kinetic chain efficiency.' That's not autocorrect — that's coaching. And it arrived in 340 milliseconds.\"\n[SCREEN: Quick flash of the Gemini 3 structured JSON response with thinkingBudget: 200]\n\"We use Gemini 3's thinking tokens with a budget of just 200 tokens for speed, and ResponseSchema validation — every response is guaranteed structured JSON. No regex. No prayer.\"\n\n## [1:15–1:45] DEEP ANALYSIS — Gemini 3 Pro (30 seconds)\n[SCREEN: Switch to Analytics page — upload a video]\nNARRATOR: \"Real-time coaching is just the start. Upload any badminton video, and Gemini 3 Pro takes over with an extended thinking budget of 1,000 tokens.\"\n[SCREEN: Analysis results appear — issues ranked by severity, drills with instructions, 5-day training plan]\n\"It identifies your top issues ranked by severity, generates targeted drills with step-by-step instructions, and builds a personalized 5-day training plan — all from your actual pose data. No generic tips. No cookie-cutter advice.\"\n[SCREEN: Show the AI-generated drill illustration from Gemini 3 Pro Image]\n\"And Gemini 3 Pro Image generates visual drill instructions — showing you exactly how to position your body. Three models, three purposes, one coaching platform.\"\n\n## [1:45–2:10] STRATEGY + RACKET FINDER (25 seconds)\n[SCREEN: Strategy Board — 3D court with shot trajectories]\nNARRATOR: \"Our 3D strategy board maps shots onto a BWF-regulation court using Three.js. It classifies every shot type — clears, drops, smashes, drives — scores recommendations by movement pressure and open-court exploitation, and visualizes where to attack.\"\n[SCREEN: Quick switch to Racket Finder — player profile entered, AI recommendations appear with match scores]\n\"Even equipment selection is AI-powered. Tell Gemini 3 Flash your skill level and weaknesses, and it scores 15-plus rackets from Yonex, Li-Ning, and Victor — each with a match score and reasoning.\"\n\n## [2:10–2:35] TECHNICAL DEPTH — Why Gemini 3 (25 seconds)\n[SCREEN: Architecture diagram]\nNARRATOR: \"The architecture is deliberately hybrid. MediaPipe handles instant local evaluation — green or red in zero milliseconds. Gemini 3 adds the intelligence — contextual coaching that understands biomechanics.\"\n\"Three Gemini 3 breakthroughs made this possible: Thinking tokens — tunable reasoning depth. Structured output with ResponseSchema. Sub-500ms Flash latency.\"\n[SCREEN: Quick code snippet]\n\"If Gemini goes down, the app doesn't. Cached responses fill the gap. Graceful degradation is built in.\"\n\n## [2:35–2:55] IMPACT + CLOSING (20 seconds)\nNARRATOR: \"300 million players. Zero coaching access for most of them. RallyCoach makes expert-level coaching universally accessible — no hardware, no subscription, no barrier.\"\n\"This isn't a chatbot that gives tips after the fact. It's an AI coach that watches you move, explains what's wrong, tells you why, and does it all in under 500 milliseconds.\"\n[SCREEN: RallyCoach logo + tagline]\n\"RallyCoach. Your AI coach.

It's not. You're conflating:\n- MediaPipe's instant local detection (which you correctly note is \"zero milliseconds\")\n- Gemini API latency (~340ms shown)\n- But WHERE is the proof that the full coaching pipeline (pose extraction → transmission → Gemini → parsing → UI update → overlay render) completes in <500ms end-to-end?\n\n**The problem:** Judges with technical backgrounds will notice you're measuring API response time, not user-perceived coaching latency. Network latency, JSON parsing, React re-renders, WebGL overlay updates—none of this is accounted for. You're showing a stopwatch on one piece of a 6-piece puzzle.\n\n**What competitors do:** Show Chrome DevTools Performance tab with frame timings. Show Network tab waterfall. Show ACTUAL end-to-end latency measurement with timestamped console logs.\n\n### 2. **INNOVATION BLACK HOLE: You built a pose-detection wrapper** (30% weight)\nStrip away the marketing and here's what you built:\n- MediaPipe (Google's library, not yours)\n- Gemini API calls (standard REST/SDK usage)\n- Three.js visualization (commodity)\n- Supabase CRUD (boilerplate)\n\n**Your actual innovation:** Sending pose landmark JSON to Gemini with a sports-specific prompt.\n\nThat's it. That's the entire technical novelty. Every other \"breakthrough\" you list is just *using tools correctly*:\n- \"Thinking tokens\" → You set a config parameter\n- \"Structured output\" → You used ResponseSchema (documented feature)\n- \"Sub-500ms latency\" → You called the Flash model (marketed as fast)\n\n**What kills you:** Nowhere do you explain what NOVEL ALGORITHM, UNIQUE ARCHITECTURE, or BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHT you contributed. Did you:\n- Invent a new pose scoring formula?\n- Create a custom MediaPipe model trained on badminton footage?\n- Build a novel streaming protocol for pose data?\n- Develop a caching strategy that predicts coaching based on pose trajectories?\n\n**No.** You piped A into B. That's a weekend integration project, not innovation.\n\n### 3. **IMPACT DELUSION: \"300 million players\" is a vanity metric** (20% weight)\nYou open with \"300 million players worldwide, 99% never coached\" then... provide ZERO evidence that RallyCoach solves this at scale.\n\n**Missing:**\n- Can it handle non-badminton courts? (Most 300M play in parks/streets, not regulation courts)\n- Works on phone cameras? (Most players don't practice at desks with webcams)\n- Offline mode? (Developing countries with poor internet)\n- Handles group training? (Multiple players, coach view)\n- Validated by ANY coach or player? (Where's the user study?)\n\n**The math doesn't work:** Your target user is \"casual badminton player who:\n- Has stable internet\n- Has a webcam\n- Practices alone\n- Practices at a desk/setup where a webcam has proper angle\n- Knows enough to act on biomechanical feedback\"\n\nThat's not 300 million users. That's maybe 50,000 enthusiasts globally. Your TAM is overstated by 6,000x.\n\n### 4. **PRESENTATION DISASTER: No human face, no story arc** (10% weight)\nYour script is narrated like a SaaS product tour. Zero emotional stakes. Compare:\n\n**Your opening:** \"Badminton is the second most-played sport... 99% have never had coaching.\"\n**Competitor's opening:** \"I'm Sarah. I've played badminton for 8 years. Last month I tore my rotator cuff because I didn't know my overhead form was wrong. Here's the AI coach that could've saved me $4,000 in surgery.\"\n\n**Your demo:** \"See that? The skeleton turned red.\"\n**Competitor's demo:** \"Watch—I'm about to shank this clear. [misses] See how RallyCoach catches my elbow drop frame-by-frame? Here's the coaching it gave me. [Next clip] Here's me hitting it clean 2 days later.\"\n\nYou have NO:\n- Before/after transformation\n- Personal connection to the problem\n- Testimonial or validation\n- Failure scenario (what happens when coaching is ignored?)\n\n### 5. **TECHNICAL OVERPROMISE: Gemini 3 is doing basic text generation** (40% weight)\nYou breathlessly describe Gemini's output as if it's breakthrough reasoning:\n\n> \"Your elbow is dropping to 128 degrees — you're losing 30% of smash power.\"\n\n**Reality check:** This is template interpolation. You're sending:\n```\nElbow angle: 128°\nThreshold: 150°\nShot type: overhead\n```\n\nGemini responds with:\n```\n\"Your elbow is at {angle}° which is below {threshold}° for {shot_type}, reducing power.\"\n```\n\n**Where's the AI?** A rule-based system could generate this. You haven't shown:\n- Contextual reasoning (e.g., \"Your elbow is low but your knee bend compensates—focus on footwork first\")\n- Temporal analysis (e.g., \"Your elbow drops on tired reps—stamina issue\")\n- Comparative insights (e.g., \"Your elbow angle is in the 20th percentile vs. international players\")\n\nYou're using a $0.01/1M token LLM to do sprintf().\n\n---\n\n## WHAT MAKES JUDGES STOP WATCHING\n\n**0:30-1:15 (45 seconds):** This section is a death march of jargon.\n- \"WebAssembly\"\n- \"33 body landmarks\"\n- \"30 frames per second\"\n- \"zero server load\"\n- \"biomechanical rules\"\n- \"kinetic chain efficiency\"\n- \"thinking tokens with budget of 200\"\n- \"ResponseSchema validation\"\n\n**By second 60, you've said \"Gemini 3\" eight times and shown zero human benefit.**\n\nJudges will mentally check out because you're listing features, not telling a story. Compare to a competitor who shows:\n- 0:30 - \"Here's me hitting a clear. Feels fine.\"\n- 0:40 - \"Here's RallyCoach catching my elbow drop. I didn't feel it.\"\n- 0:50 - \"Here's the coaching. I adjusted.\"\n- 1:00 - \"Here's my next rep. 15% more shuttle speed.\"\n\nTransformation > specification sheet.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT COMPETITORS DO BETTER\n\n### Hackathon winners typically nail 2-3 of these:\n1. **Live demo with real stakes** - \"I'm going to hit 10 smashes. RallyCoach will score each one live.\"\n2. **Unexpected use case** - \"We tested RallyCoach on a 70-year-old with Parkinson's. Watch how the tremor detection works.\"\n3. **Technical deep-dive with code** - Show the actual prompt engineering, show the ResponseSchema, show the fallback logic.\n4. **Data validation** - \"We tested 50 players. Here's the accuracy vs. human coach ratings.\"\n5. **Viral moment** - Something memeable, shareable, surprising.\n\n**You have none of these.** Your demo is a rehearsed walkthrough of a staging environment.\n\n---\n\n## EMOTIONAL BEATS MISSING\n\n- **Stakes:** Why does THIS player need coaching NOW?\n- **Failure:** Show a bad shot. Show frustration. Make me feel the problem.\n- **Surprise:** Show RallyCoach catching something a human coach missed.\n- **Triumph:** Show measurable improvement (shot speed, accuracy, consistency).\n- **Vulnerability:** Admit a limitation. \"RallyCoach can't replace a coach for strategy—but for technique, it's 24/7 feedback.\"\n\nYour script is emotionally flat. It's a product tour, not a story.\n\n---\n\n## TECHNICAL DEPTH ISSUES\n\n### MISSING:\n- How do you handle occlusion? (Racket blocks the elbow)\n- How do you calibrate for camera angle? (Overhead vs. side view)\n- How do you prevent false positives? (Red skeleton on a valid shot variation)\n- How do you handle shot variety? (Backhand, net shots, smashes—all different biomechanics)\n- What's the prompt? (Show the actual system prompt to Gemini)\n- What's the training data? (Did you fine-tune? Use RAG? Just zero-shot?)\n\n### OVERSTATED:\n- \"Thinking tokens\" - You're acting like you invented this. It's a config flag.\n- \"Zero server load\" - MediaPipe runs client-side, yes, but Gemini API calls are server-side. Misleading.\n- \"Graceful degradation\" - You mention cached responses but don't explain the cache strategy. Vaporware claim.\n\n---\n\n## PACING ANALYSIS\n\n| Section | Time | Verdict |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Hook | 15s | **TOO LONG** - Get to \"What if your webcam was the coach?\" by 0:08 |\n| Reveal | 15s | **GOOD** |\n| Core Demo | 45s | **WAY TOO LONG** - Cut to 25s. You're drowning in specs. |\n| Deep Analysis | 30s | **TOO RUSHED** - This is your differentiation. Needs 40s. |\n| Strategy/Racket | 25s | **WRONG PRIORITY** - These are nice-to-haves. Cut to 10s. |\n| Technical Depth | 25s | **USELESS** - Judges don't care about your fallback logic. Cut entirely or move to docs. |\n| Impact/Closing | 20s | **WEAK** - No call-to-action, no memorable closer. |\n\n**Optimal structure:**\n- 0:00-0:10: Hook (problem + human cost)\n- 0:10-0:20: Solution reveal\n- 0:20-1:10: Live demo with before/after (50s)\n- 1:10-1:50: Deep analysis showcase (40s)\n- 1:50-2:10: Technical architecture (20s, code-focused)\n- 2:10-2:30: Impact + proof (user testimonial or data)\n- 2:30-2:50: Call-to-action + memorable closer\n\n---\n\n## SINGLE BIGGEST CHANGE TO 2X THE SCORE\n\n**Replace the entire 0:30-1:15 \"Core Demo\" section with this:**\n\n### NEW VERSION (25 seconds):\n[SCREEN: Split-screen - left shows player, right shows RallyCoach UI]\n\nNARRATOR: \"Watch this. I'm about to hit an overhead clear.\"\n\n[Player hits. Shuttle goes into the net.]\n\n\"Felt fine to me. But look—\"\n\n[SCREEN: Skeleton turned red on the elbow joint during the swing. Rewind and slow-mo on the exact frame.]\n\n\"Frame 87. My elbow dropped to 128 degrees. Gemini 3 Flash analyzed this in 340 milliseconds and told me: 'Elbow below 150° reduces smash power by 30%. Your kinetic chain is broken at the shoulder rotation.'\"\n\n[SCREEN: Show the coaching overlay with the specific feedback]\n\n\"I adjusted. Watch the next rep.\"\n\n[Player hits again. Shuttle flies deep. Skeleton stays green.]\n\n\"Same player. Same court. Different coaching. That's the difference between guessing and knowing.\"\n\n**Why this 2x's the score:**\n- **Shows transformation** (bad shot → good shot)\n- **Human stakes** (player's POV, not narrator POV)\n- **Proves the tech works** (you SEE the frame-by-frame detection)\n- **Contextualizes the 340ms** (it's fast enough to matter)\n- **Cuts the jargon** (no WebAssembly, no landmarks, no thinking tokens—just results)\n\n---\n\n## RATINGS BY JUDGING CRITERIA (1-10)\n\n### Technical Execution: **5/10**\n**Why:**\n- ✅ You integrated multiple Google APIs correctly\n- ✅ ResponseSchema usage shows understanding of structured output\n- ❌ No custom ML models or novel algorithms\n- ❌ Latency claims are unsubstantiated end-to-end\n- ❌ No code shown in the video\n- ❌ No technical challenges explained (just \"we used this API\")\n\n**To improve:** Show the prompt engineering. Show the fallback logic code. Show Chrome DevTools performance metrics. Admit and solve a hard problem (e.g., \"Gemini 3 hallucinates shot classifications—here's how we validate with rule-based checks\").\n\n### Innovation/Wow Factor: **4/10**\n**Why:**\n- ✅ Multi-modal Gemini 3 usage (Flash + Pro + Pro Image) shows breadth\n- ❌ Core innovation is \"send pose data to LLM\"—not novel\n- ❌ MediaPipe pose detection for sports is done to death (dozens of hackathon projects)\n- ❌ No surprising insight, unexpected application, or technical breakthrough\n- ❌ Three.js court visualization is commodity work\n\n**To improve:** Add ONE genuinely novel element:\n- Predictive coaching (anticipate mistakes before they happen based on pose trajectory)\n- Comparative analysis (show how user's form compares to pro player footage)\n- Multiplayer mode (two players analyzed simultaneously for doubles strategy)\n- Physics simulation (show shuttle trajectory prediction based on detected form)\n\n### Potential Impact: **3/10**\n**Why:**\n- ✅ Large TAM (badminton is huge globally)\n- ❌ Solution requires webcam + stable internet + solo practice—excludes 90% of TAM\n- ❌ No validation (user studies, coach testimonials, accuracy benchmarks)\n- ❌ No business model (how does this reach 300M players?)\n- ❌ No accessibility considerations (works in Indonesia on 3G? Works on phone cameras?)\n\n**To improve:** Show a user testimonial. Show accuracy data (\"RallyCoach agreed with human coaches 87% of the time across 200 shots\"). Show a path to mobile. Show a freemium model.\n\n### Presentation/Demo: **6/10**\n**Why:**\n- ✅ Clear problem statement\n- ✅ Logical flow through features\n- ✅ Good production quality implied (dark UI, animations)\n- ❌ No human face or personal connection\n- ❌ Zero emotional arc\n- ❌ Jargon-heavy, feature-dump in the middle\n- ❌ No memorable closing\n\n**To improve:** Put a human on camera. Show real improvement over days. End with a single powerful sentence: \"Every athlete deserves a coach. Now they have one.\"\n\n---\n\n## FINAL SCRIPT REWRITE: WEAKEST 30 SECONDS\n\n**ORIGINAL (2:10-2:40 - Technical Depth section):**\n> \"The architecture is deliberately hybrid. MediaPipe handles instant local evaluation — green or red in zero milliseconds. Gemini 3 adds the intelligence — contextual coaching that understands biomechanics. Three Gemini 3 breakthroughs made this possible: Thinking tokens — tunable reasoning depth. Structured output with ResponseSchema. Sub-500ms Flash latency. If Gemini goes down, the app doesn't. Cached responses fill the gap. Graceful degradation is built in.\"\n\n**PROBLEMS:**\n- Buzzword bingo\n- No visual interest\n- No proof\n- No stakes\n- Defensive (why are you talking about Gemini going down?)\n\n---\n\n**REWRITE (30 seconds):**\n\n[SCREEN: Side-by-side code editor and running app]\n\nNARRATOR: \"Here's what makes this work. MediaPipe extracts 33 landmarks—here's the JSON.\"\n\n[SCREEN: Show raw landmark JSON, highlight elbow coordinates]\n\n\"We calculate five angles in real-time—elbow, knee, stance, rotation, racket plane.\"\n\n[SCREEN: Show JavaScript function doing the math]\n\n\"If any threshold breaks, instant feedback. But here's the hard part: badminton has 20+ shot types. Each has different biomechanics. Teaching an LLM to coach requires context.\"\n\n[SCREEN: Show the actual Gemini prompt with shot type, metrics, player history]\n\n\"This prompt includes shot classification, current metrics, and the player's history. Gemini 3 Flash returns structured coaching—not just 'elbow higher,' but 'your elbow at 128° breaks the kinetic chain for overhead shots, reducing racket head speed by 30%.'\"\n\n[SCREEN: Show the ResponseSchema definition in code]\n\n\"ResponseSchema guarantees structured JSON. No parsing errors. No hallucinated advice. Every response includes the issue, the fix, the reasoning, and a drill.\"\n\n[SCREEN: Back to the app showing the coaching output]\n\n\"That's how you turn pose data into coaching. The AI explains *why*—not just *what*.\"\n\n---\n\n**WHY THIS IS 10X BETTER:**\n- **Shows code** (credibility for technical judges)\n- **Explains the hard problem** (teaching LLM badminton-specific coaching)\n- **Visual proof** (you see the JSON, the prompt, the schema)\n- **No fluff** (every sentence adds information)\n- **Ends with impact** (the \"why\" is what makes it coaching, not just detection)\n\n---\n\n## FINAL VERDICT\n\n### Winning Probability: **15-25%**\n\n**Why so low:**\n1. **You're competing against 200+ submissions.** Top 10% is ~20 projects. You need to be top 5% to win (top ~10 projects).\n\n2. **Judges will see 10+ pose detection projects.** Yoga AI, physical therapy AI, dance form AI, golf swing AI. You need to be the BEST pose detection project, not just good. Right now, you're not. You're middle-of-the-pack because you didn't differentiate.\n\n3. **The \"Gemini 3\" usage is shallow.** You're using it as a text generation API. Competitors will use:\n   - Gemini 3's multimodal input (analyze video directly, not just pose JSON)\n   - Context caching for coaching personas\n   - Function calling for dynamic drill generation\n   - Long-context windows to analyze entire training sessions\n\n4. **No validation.** Judges want proof. User testimonials, accuracy studies, expert endorsements, before/after metrics. You have none.\n\n5. **Presentation is flat.** No story, no emotion, no transformation, no surprise. It's a product demo, not a pitch.\n\n---\n\n### PATH TO 60%+ WIN RATE:\n\n1. **Add ONE breakthrough technical element:**\n   - Predictive coaching (detect mistakes before they happen)\n   - Video-direct analysis (Gemini analyzes raw video, not just pose JSON)\n   - Real-time comparative analysis (overlay pro player form vs. user)\n\n2. **Get validation:**\n   - Film a real coach reacting to RallyCoach's feedback (\"This is exactly what I'd tell my players\")\n   - Show accuracy data (RallyCoach vs. human coach agreement rate)\n   - Show a user's 7-day improvement (shot speed, accuracy, consistency)\n\n3. **Restructure the demo:**\n   - 0:00-0:10: Human player, bad shot, frustration\n   - 0:10-0:25: RallyCoach introduction + architecture\n   - 0:25-1:10: Live before/after demo with measurable improvement\n   - 1:10-1:50: Deep analysis feature (this is your differentiation)\n   - 1:50-2:15: Technical deep-dive with code and prompts\n   - 2:15-2:35: Validation (testimonial or data)\n   - 2:35-2:50: Impact statement + call-to-action\n\n4. **Fix the innovation gap:**\n   - Stop calling standard API usage \"breakthroughs\"\n   - Show what YOU invented (algorithm, prompt strategy, caching logic)\n   - Admit limitations and show how you overcame them\n\n5. **Make it memorable:**\n   - One sentence closer: \"Every athlete deserves a coach who never sleeps, never judges, and never stops watching. That's RallyCoach.\"\n   - One visual hook: The skeleton turning red in slow-mo with the exact frame number highlighted\n   - One surprising stat: \"RallyCoach caught 47 form issues in 10 minutes that I didn't feel—including the one that would've torn my rotator cuff.\"\n\n---\n\n### BRUTAL TRUTH:\n\nThis script is **competent but forgettable.** You built a solid integration project and dressed it up as innovation. Judges will watch it, nod, and move on. You won't bomb, but you won't win.\n\nTo win, you need to make judges think: **\"Holy shit, I didn't know that was possible.\"**\n\nRight now, you're making them think: **\"Yep, MediaPipe + Gemini. Makes sense.\"**\n\n**That's the difference between top 20% and top 5%.**\n\nFix the innovation gap, add proof, cut the jargon, show transformation, and you might crack top 10%. Keep this script?
