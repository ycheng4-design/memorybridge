That's a coach watching me swing.\"\n\n---\n\n## [1:05–1:15] THE TECHNICAL HOOK — Why Gemini 3 (10 seconds)\n\n**[SCREEN: Quick split — left shows a code snippet of the Gemini call with `thinkingConfig: { thinkingBudget: 200 }` and `responseSchema`, right shows the structured JSON response.]**\n\n**NARRATOR:**\n\"Under the hood: Gemini 3's **thinking tokens** — budgeted at just 200 tokens for speed. **ResponseSchema** validation — every response is typed, structured JSON. No regex hacks. No prompt-and-pray. And if Gemini goes down? Our local rules engine keeps coaching. The app never stops.\"\n\n---\n\n## [1:15–1:55] DEEP ANALYSIS — Gemini 3 Pro (40 seconds)\n\n**[SCREEN: Switch to the Analytics page. Upload a video file.]**\n\n**NARRATOR:**\n\"Real-time coaching handles the moment. But what about the big picture? Upload any badminton video, and **Gemini 3 Pro** takes over — with an extended thinking budget of 1,000 tokens for deep reasoning.\"\n\n**[SCREEN: Analysis results load — show the top issues panel with severity badges (HIGH, MEDIUM)]**\n\n\"It identifies your top issues, ranked by severity. Here — 'Overhead elbow position: HIGH severity.' 'Knee bend during recovery: MEDIUM.'\"\n\n**[SCREEN: Scroll to drills section with step-by-step instructions]**\n\n\"Then it generates targeted drills — not generic tips, specific instructions based on YOUR pose data: 'Pause at the contact point. Check that your elbow is above 150 degrees. Repeat 20 times.'\"\n\n**[SCREEN: Show the 5-day training plan]**\n\n\"And it builds a **personalized 5-day training plan** — Day 1: Footwork Basics. Day 3: Combined Practice. Day 5: Match Play.\"\n\n**[SCREEN: Show the AI-generated drill illustration from Gemini 3 Pro Image]**\n\n\"**Gemini 3 Pro Image** even generates visual drill instructions — showing you exactly how to position your body. Three Gemini 3 models. Three purposes. One coaching platform.\"\n\n---\n\n## [1:55–2:15] STRATEGY + THE FULL PICTURE (20 seconds)\n\n**[SCREEN: 3D Strategy Board — interactive Three.js court with shot trajectories rendering in real time]**\n\n**NARRATOR:**\n\"Our 3D strategy board maps every shot type onto a BWF-regulation court — clears, drops, smashes, drives. It scores where to attack based on movement pressure and open-court exploitation.\"\n\n**[SCREEN: Quick flash — Dashboard with Recharts progress graphs showing form scores trending upward over multiple sessions]**\n\n\"And the dashboard tracks your progress over time. Session after session, you can see your form score climbing — from 62% in week one to 89% by week four. That's not a demo. That's real improvement.\"\n\n---\n\n## [2:15–2:35] ARCHITECTURE — How It All Connects (20 seconds)\n\n**[SCREEN: Clean architecture diagram animating layer by layer:]**\n**Browser (MediaPipe WASM) → Next.js 14 API Routes → Gemini 3 (Flash / Pro / Pro Image) → Supabase (Auth, DB, Storage)**\n\n**NARRATOR:**\n\"The architecture is deliberately hybrid. MediaPipe handles instant local detection — green or red in zero milliseconds. Gemini 3 adds contextual intelligence — nuanced coaching grounded in biomechanics.\"\n\n**[SCREEN: Table showing the three models with their thinking budgets and latencies]**\n\n\"Flash for live coaching at 200 thinking tokens. Pro for deep analysis at 1,000. Pro Image for visual drill instructions. Each model tuned for its job.\"\n\n---\n\n## [2:35–2:55] IMPACT + THE CLOSE (20 seconds)\n\n**[SCREEN: Split screen — left: player practicing alone with no feedback. Right: same player with RallyCoach, skeleton overlay, coaching cues, AI commentary flowing in real time.]**\n\n**NARRATOR:**\n\"300 million people play badminton. Most will never afford a coach. RallyCoach doesn't replace the coach — it puts one in every browser, for free.\"\n\n\"This isn't a chatbot that gives tips after the fact. It's an AI that watches you move, catches what you miss, explains why it matters, and does it all before your next swing.\"\n\n**[SCREEN: Fade to RallyCoach logo on dark background. Tagline appears letter by letter:]**\n\n**\"Every athlete deserves a coach who never sleeps.\"**\n**Powered by Google Gemini 3.**\n\n---\n\n## [2:55–3:00] END CARD (5 seconds)\n\n**[SCREEN: Tech stack logos arranged cleanly — Google Gemini 3, MediaPipe, Next.js 14, Three.js, Supabase, FastAPI.

Use screen recording with a slight zoom-in when the skeleton turns red. Add a subtle pulse/glow effect in post-production if possible.\n\n2. **0:40 — The Three-Layer Zoom**: Cue → Commentary → Reasoning. Each gets 3 seconds of focused attention. Use smooth pan-down animation between them.\n\n3. **0:55 — The Fix**: Player adjusts and skeleton goes green. This is the payoff. Let the \"287ms\" latency badge be visible.\n\n4. **1:10 — Code Snippet**: Show REAL code, not pseudo-code. The `thinkingConfig` and `responseSchema` lines from `gemini.ts` are visually distinctive and technically impressive.\n\n5. **1:40 — Drill Illustration**: The AI-generated image is a \"holy shit, it can do that too?\" moment. Give it 3 full seconds on screen.\n\n6. **2:00 — Progress Chart**: The upward trend line tells the story of improvement without words. Let it breathe for 2 seconds.\n\n## Pacing Guidelines:\n- **NEVER spend more than 8 seconds talking without a screen change**\n- **Every sentence should either SHOW something or PROVE something**\n- **Cut any sentence that starts with \"We also...\" or \"Additionally...\"**\n- **The first 15 seconds determine whether judges keep watching — make them visceral**\n\n## Voice/Tone:\n- Conversational, not corporate\n- Confident, not boastful (\"This is how it works\" not \"We brilliantly engineered...\")\n- Specific numbers always (\"340 milliseconds\" not \"very fast\")\n- Personal connection at the start, technical authority in the middle, emotional impact at the end\n\n## What NOT to Say:\n- \"Full-stack\" (overused hackathon buzzword)\n- \"End-to-end\" (means nothing to judges)\n- \"Leveraging\" (corporate speak)\n- \"Game-changer\" (prove it, don't say it)\n- \"Unprecedented\" (let judges decide)\n","numLines":185,"startLine":1,"totalLines":185}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0862e2f3-ad6b-4b54-b440-35b3eb15f3aa"}
