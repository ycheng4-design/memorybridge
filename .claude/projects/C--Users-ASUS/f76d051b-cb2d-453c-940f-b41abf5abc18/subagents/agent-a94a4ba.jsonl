This represents a significant improvement from earlier versions where users had to enable WebXR Device API and WebXR Hand Input Module under Experimental XR Features.\n\n## Web-Based XR Deployment (Without Native App)\n\nWebXR experiences can be accessed near-instantly via the web browser like any other web app, with no installation or updates required, and developers don't need approval from a central app store authority. WebXR requires a secure context to use, and aside from a HTTPS website, the other secure context is localhost on your development machine.\n\n## 2024-2025 Updates\n\nSafari on visionOS 2.0 supports immersive virtual reality sessions on the Vision Pro. The recent developments include a new transient-pointer input mode available for Safari 17.4 in visionOS 1.1, which enables more natural interaction using Apple Vision Pro's gaze-and-pinch system.\n\nHowever, I should note that the search results did not return specific information about the \"WebSpatial SDK\" or the \"XR_ENV=avp\" environment variable you mentioned. The standard approach appears to be using the WebXR API directly with frameworks like A-Frame, Three.js, or Babylon.js for deploying immersive experiences.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b43c6d9e-f21e-4118-8ded-bf9fd3e7d1be","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:18:35.323Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"16025f23-c81f-48aa-a431-2d8e622ca29a"}

It enables the entire HTML/CSS-based Web world to step into the spatial era, gaining spatial power on par with native apps (like visionOS apps) while keeping the advantages they already have.\n\n## Key Features for visionOS Development\n\nThe WebSpatial SDK can be added to web projects, and WebSpatial Builder can be used for visionOS testing (simulator or device), allowing developers to bring spatial features to their site while still keeping it a standard, cross-platform website.\n\n## Development Approach\n\nYou can continue coding with React, CSS, JS and web-dev tools you already know, as WebSpatial extends your existing web stack with a minimal set of new spatial APIs, drops straight into any project, and unlocks native-grade spatial power with almost no code changes or extra cost.\n\n## Platform Requirements\n\nTo develop on Apple Vision Pro, you should ensure you are using the latest versions of visionOS and Xcode.\n\nThe WebSpatial GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/webspatial/webspatial-sdk, and the documentation can be found at https://webspatial.dev/.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ca7887c5-48df-4826-8299-36eaa9998d1d","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:19:20.700Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"909ee254-e2e7-4c05-8af0-2d060fd0c754"}

The visionOS SDK requires a Mac with M1, M2 or M3 chips, though newer Apple Silicon models should also be compatible. Intel-based Macs are not supported for visionOS simulator development.\n\n## macOS and Xcode Requirements\n\nUsing the visionOS simulator in Xcode targets Apple Silicon-based Macs (M1/M2/M3), requiring macOS 14 or higher. For Xcode specifically, you need to have Xcode 15, with more recent versions like Xcode 26 now available in 2025.\n\n## visionOS Simulator\n\nYou can interact with your app in the visionOS simulator and explore various room layouts and lighting conditions. In 2025, Xcode 26 includes a new 'Vision Pro 4K' simulator with improved graphics capabilities.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7812fa4b-c342-43db-931d-8beec1a11780","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:20:02.562Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d968e210-3872-4917-88b7-92c33e4e43e9"}

The Spatial Browsing capability in Safari for visionOS 26 doesn't introduce or rely on new Web APIs, so it's merely an app-level, reader-mode-like feature available only on a limited small set of qualifying, article-centric pages.\n\n## Native App Requirement for Full Spatial Effects\n\nA WebSpatial App is a type of multitasking Spatial App that works inside the Shared Space and adds minimal new spatial APIs to mainstream Web APIs. A native Spatial App called the WebSpatial App Shell loads and runs the Web code, with the App Shell using native spatial capabilities to spatialize 2D content and render 3D content.\n\nImportantly, if the upcoming WebSpatial Browser app (currently under development) is pre-installed on the target platform, you can open any WebSpatial App URL directly in it and experience it in spatial form without needing to package, install, or publish the app to app stores.\n\nIn summary: While WebSpatial SDK integrates with the web ecosystem, achieving full spatial effects currently requires either a packaged native app or the forthcoming WebSpatial Browser application—pure browser/web-only access does not support spatial effects.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b645b1cc-df1c-4e91-8c1c-1cdb8f8a9512","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:20:06.222Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"056fbdd0-0979-42e3-aebf-704aa53b4e1b"}

It communicates with web code via a JavaScript bridge, handling spatial rendering while the WebView manages 2D content.\n\n## WebSpatial Browser\n\nCurrently under development, this pre-installed browser app would eliminate packaging and distribution requirements—users could \"open any WebSpatial App URL directly in it and experience it in spatial form.\"\n\n## Safari Limitation\n\nNo. Safari cannot deliver spatial effects. Only the WebSpatial App Shell (native app) or the upcoming WebSpatial Browser can provide spatial capabilities.\n\n## Packaged App vs. Web URL\n\n**Packaged apps** are installable native bundles for specific platforms (visionOS) submitted to app stores. **Web URLs** work in the WebSpatial Browser without installation, offering cross-platform reach and shareability."}]},"uuid":"faa6aac9-2c00-46ab-9572-4fb8e6cf1c01","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:20:16.246Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"31d89193-c715-47de-bd28-9261b4dbb4e0"}

It includes a CLI tool that packages WebSpatial-enabled React projects into installable native spatial app, wrapping web code in a platform-specific App Shell that runs WebSpatial APIs.\n\n## visionOS Pre-installed Apps\n\nRegarding pre-installed applications on visionOS, Apple-made apps that come preinstalled on visionOS include Mail, Messages, Mindfulness, Apple Music, Apple TV, Notes, Photos, and Freeform. WebSpatial Browser is not listed as a pre-installed app on visionOS.\n\n## WebSpatial Platform Support\n\nWebSpatial currently supports visionOS devices (such as Vision Pro) with Android XR devices, Meta Quest/Horizon OS devices, and PICO devices planned for future support.\n\n## Developer Documentation\n\nThe WebSpatial project provides development resources at `webspatial.dev`, where developers can learn how to build spatial apps using the WebSpatial SDK and tools. WebSpatial's packaging tool turns your website into a Packaged WebSpatial App and is the must-have dev tool right now for developing, testing, and distributing WebSpatial apps on visionOS.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"bcdeb2ef-f381-4bc2-a14a-d620c1650c99","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:20:28.682Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"01d04e4c-9370-4224-839d-493a65840e5b"}

Instead, it discusses the **WebSpatial SDK**—an open-source development toolkit built on existing web frameworks like React that implements WebSpatial APIs before browsers natively support them.\n\n## Web URL Delivery\n\nThe solution maintains the web's core advantage: **\"install-free apps\"** delivered via URLs. The presentation notes that \"Instant Apps\" launch via links, run on demand, and are disposable by default—a critical feature for AI device ecosystems.\n\n## Mac Requirements\n\nThe document makes no mention of Mac requirements.\n\n## Delivery Modes\n\nThe presentation describes two implementation approaches:\n\n1. **Browser-integrated**: Where the WebSpatial Runtime integrates into browsers, allowing sites to run as PWAs\n2. **Standalone packaging**: Similar to Electron, bundling the WebSpatial Runtime with web apps for platforms where browser modification isn't possible"}]},"uuid":"769ed7d1-01d8-49b2-91e1-3d235b393da4","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:20:51.837Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"341cd3f6-81b5-407c-895a-6e191f42e045"}

The basic parts you'll need to know are Xcode, SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit and TestFlight - and some 3D modeling tools.\n\nNote: While Xcode itself runs on Mac, if you're using a Windows computer, you may need additional software or a virtual machine to install Xcode.\n\n## Getting Started with Development\n\nStart the software development process by downloading Xcode — Apple's integrated development environment. Xcode offers a complete set of tools to develop software, including project management support, code editors, visual editors for your UI, debugging tools, simulators for different devices, tools for assessing performance, and much more.\n\nTo create a new project in Xcode, choose File > New > Project and follow the prompts to create a visionOS app. All new projects use SwiftUI, which offers a modern declarative programming model to create your app's core functionality.\n\n## Key Development Components\n\nThe development process involves downloading the visionOS SDK and utilizing familiar tools like SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit, Unity, Reality Composer Pro, and Xcode, which are also used for building on other Apple operating systems.\n\nApple is introducing Reality Composer Pro. This Xcode feature simplifies the process of previewing 3D models, images, sounds, and animations on the headset.\n\n## Deployment to Vision Pro\n\nConnect your Mac and Apple Vision Pro to the same network. Navigate to Settings > General > Remote Devices and remove any computer listed. Navigate to Window > Devices and Simulators. Find the Vision Pro in the list on the left-hand side of this window. Select it and hit pair.\n\nNote: The search results did not return specific information about \"webspatial SDK\" or \"packaged webspatial app\" terminology. If you're looking for more specific details about those particular terms, you may want to consult Apple's official visionOS documentation directly.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"75af8c25-2e83-45ca-be6d-b0c6af1baac4","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:21:20.223Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"34437caa-10ab-4a69-8185-5e832d69f1f3"}

You can also watch this video for a quick overview of everything in the doc.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Create a modern web project that supports WebSpatial\n\nFirst confirm that Node.js is installed (see the Node.js official website).\n\nUsing a standard React + Vite + TypeScript project as an example, run the following commands to create the project:\n\n**NPM Command:**\n```\nnpx create-vite --template react-ts\n```\n\n**PNPM Command:**\n```\npnpm dlx create-vite --template react-ts\n```\n\n**Yarn Command:**\n```\nyarn dlx create-vite --template react-ts\n```\n\n**Tip:** See what kinds of web projects are considered WebSpatial-supported for details.\n\nAfter the above command is completed, navigate to the project root directory and install the dependencies:\n\n**NPM:**\n```\ncd YOUR_PROJECT_PATH\nnpm install\n```\n\n**PNPM:**\n```\ncd YOUR_PROJECT_PATH\npnpm install\n```\n\n**Yarn:**\n```\ncd YOUR_PROJECT_PATH\nyarn install\n```\n\nThen you can run the Dev Server to confirm everything works (remember to turn off this server before proceeding with the subsequent steps):\n\n**NPM:**\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n**PNPM:**\n```\npnpm run dev\n```\n\n**Yarn:**\n```\nyarn dev\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Install the WebSpatial SDK\n\nRun the following command under your project root:\n\nCheck the video tutorial at 0:26\n\n**NPM:**\n```\nnpm install --save @webspatial/react-sdk @webspatial/core-sdk @google/model-viewer three\nnpm install --save-dev @webspatial/builder @webspatial/platform-visionos @webspatial/vite-plugin vite-plugin-html\n```\n\n**PNPM:**\n```\npnpm add @webspatial/react-sdk @webspatial/core-sdk @google/model-viewer three\npnpm add --save-dev @webspatial/builder @webspatial/platform-visionos @webspatial/vite-plugin vite-plugin-html\n```\n\n**Yarn:**\n```\nyarn add @webspatial/react-sdk @webspatial/core-sdk @google/model-viewer three\nyarn add --dev @webspatial/builder @webspatial/platform-visionos @webspatial/vite-plugin vite-plugin-html\n```\n\n**Tip:** See which dependencies are installed for details.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Integrate the WebSpatial SDK into the web build tool (Vite)\n\nFirst modify `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`, adding the configuration that affects JSX compilation.\n\n**Configuration:**\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsxImportSource\": \"@webspatial/react-sdk\",\n```\n\nThen modify `vite.config.ts`:\n\n- Add WebSpatial's Vite plugin.\n- Inject the environment variable `$XR_ENV` into HTML.\n\n**Configuration:**\n```javascript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport react from \"@vitejs/plugin-react\";\nimport webSpatial from \"@webspatial/vite-plugin\";\nimport { createHtmlPlugin } from \"vite-plugin-html\";\n\n// https://vite.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    react(),\n    webSpatial(),\n    createHtmlPlugin({\n      inject: {\n        data: {\n          XR_ENV: process.env.XR_ENV,\n        },\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n});\n```\n\nRun the Dev Server for desktop/mobile and other non-XR platforms (keep it running in the following steps):\n\n**NPM:**\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n**PNPM:**\n```\npnpm run dev\n```\n\n**Yarn:**\n```\nyarn dev\n```\n\nOpen the URL shown in the terminal in a desktop browser such as Chrome to confirm everything works.\n\nNext, open a new terminal window (in the project root) and run another Dev Server to generate web code specifically for WebSpatial, used in the WebSpatial app on visionOS (keep it running in the following steps):\n\n**NPM:**\n```\nXR_ENV=avp npm run dev\n```\n\n**PNPM:**\n```\nXR_ENV=avp pnpm run dev\n```\n\n**Yarn:**\n```\nXR_ENV=avp yarn dev\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Package and run the WebSpatial app\n\nBefore using the packaging tool for WebSpatial, install Xcode and the visionOS simulator:\n\n**Tip:** Prerequisite: a Mac computer\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Open the Mac App Store, search for \"Xcode\", and install it.\n2. On first launch, agree to the license and enter the admin password to install additional components.\n3. Click the top menu \"Xcode\" > \"Settings…\". In the \"Components\" tab, find visionOS and visionOS Simulator under \"Platform Support\", then install both.\n\nRun the development command (`run`) of the packaging tool:\n\nCheck the video tutorial at 3:22\n\n**NPM:**\n```\nnpx webspatial-builder run --base=$XR_DEV_SERVER\n```\n\n**PNPM:**\n```\npnpm dlx webspatial-builder run --base=$XR_DEV_SERVER\n```\n\n**Yarn:**\n```\nyarn dlx webspatial-builder run --base=$XR_DEV_SERVER\n```\n\n**Warning:** Replace `$XR_DEV_SERVER` with the URL generated by `XR_ENV=avp npm run dev` in the previous step. For Example: The URL generated from Step 3 is `http://localhost:5175/webspatial/avp`. You Should run: `npx webspatial-builder run --base=http://localhost:5175/webspatial/avp`\n\nThe visionOS simulator will automatically launch, installs the Packaged WebSpatial App, and runs it.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Set initialization properties for the start scene\n\nCreate an incomplete Web App Manifest file (this only works with the `webspatial-builder run` command, you'll need to complete it before running on a real device or distributing it).\n\n**Command:**\n```\ntouch public/manifest.webmanifest\n```\n\nSet the default size for the start scene in `xr_main_scene`.\n\n**Configuration:**\n```json\n{\n  \"xr_main_scene\": {\n    \"default_size\": {\n      \"width\": 500,\n      \"height\": 1000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRun the `run` command of the WebSpatial Builder again. The app's start scene now appears with a mobile app style.\n\n**Note:** A current bug may leave the start scene blank after repackaging. If this happens, delete the app in the simulator, quit the simulator, then package and run again. If the issue persists, delete `node_modules` in the project and reinstall dependencies.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Add a new scene\n\nFirst add a new page. In this demo we use client-side routing.\n\nCreate `src/SecondPage.tsx`.\n\nCheck the sample code in GitHub for this step if you have any question about the code you need to add.\n\n**Code for SecondPage.tsx:**\n```typescript\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\n\nfunction SecondPage() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>Second Page</h1>\n      <div className=\"card\">\n        <button onClick={() => setCount(count => count + 1)}>\n          count is {count}\n        </button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default SecondPage;\n```\n\nAdd the following to `src/App.tsx`.\n\n```typescript\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport SecondPage from \"./SecondPage\";\n```\n\nInstall a library that supports client-side routing.\n\n**NPM:**\n```\nnpm install --save react-router-dom\n```\n\n**PNPM:**\n```\npnpm add react-router-dom\n```\n\n**Yarn:**\n```\nyarn add react-router-dom\n```\n\nMove all existing JSX in `src/App.tsx` into the designated position in the new JSX:\n\n```typescript\nreturn (\n  <Router basename={__XR_ENV_BASE__}>\n    <Routes>\n      <Route path=\"/second-page\" element={<SecondPage />} />\n      <Route\n        path=\"/\"\n        element={\n          /* Move all JSX from the App component in src/App.tsx into here */\n        }\n      />\n    </Routes>\n  </Router>\n);\n```\n\n**Tip:** What is `__XR_ENV_BASE__`?\n\nThe new page `/second-page` has been added.\n\nAt the end of the existing content in `src/App.tsx` (below `<p className=\"read-the-docs\">`), add a card containing:\n\n- A link that always opens `/second-page` in a new window.\n- A button that opens `/second-page` in a window with the specified `name`.\n\n**Code to add:**\n```typescript\n<p className=\"read-the-docs\">\n  Click on the Vite and React logos to learn more\n</p>\n<div className=\"card\" style={{ marginTop: \"0px\" }}>\n  <h2>Open Second Page</h2>\n  <p>\n    <Link to=\"/second-page\" target=\"_blank\">\n      Open Second Page with a Link\n    </Link>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <button\n      onClick={() => {\n        window.open(`${__XR_ENV_BASE__}/second-page`, \"secondScene\");\n      }}>\n      Open Second Page with a Button\n    </button>\n  </p>\n</div>\n```\n\nClicking the link or button opens a new spatial-app scene that displays the content of `/second-page`.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Set initialization properties for the new scene\n\nImport the scene initialization API from the WebSpatial SDK in `src/App.tsx`.\n\n```typescript\nimport { initScene } from \"@webspatial/react-sdk\";\n```\n\nBefore the scene named `\"secondScene\"` opens, initialize it:\n\n```typescript\nonClick={() => {\n  initScene(\"secondScene\", prevConfig => {\n    return {\n      ...prevConfig,\n      defaultSize: {\n        width: 500,\n        height: 500,\n      },\n    };\n  });\n  window.open(`${__XR_ENV_BASE__}/second-page`, \"secondScene\");\n```\n\nClick the button and see that the default size of the `secondScene` scene changes.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Add material backgrounds\n\nEdit the `index.html` file to add a special classname to the `<html>` element when this web code is executed as a WebSpatial app (`XR_ENV` mode).\n\n**Code:**\n```html\n<%- XR_ENV === 'avp' ? `\n  <html lang=\"en\" class=\"is-spatial\">\n` : `\n  <html lang=\"en\">\n` %>\n```\n\nAt the end of `src/index.css`, add code that sets the scene background in `XR_ENV` mode to a fully transparent material (using `--xr-background-material` from the WebSpatial API):\n\n**CSS:**\n```css\nhtml.is-spatial {\n  background-color: transparent;\n  --xr-background-material: transparent;\n}\n```\n\nModify `src/App.tsx` to make both card elements \"spatialized HTML elements\" by adding a specific mark, and give them different classnames. Spatialize the link inside `link-card` as well.\n\n**Code modifications:**\n```typescript\n<h1>Vite + React</h1>\n<div className=\"card\">\n  <div className=\"card count-card\" enable-xr>\n    {/* existing content */}\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"card\">\n  <div className=\"card link-card\" enable-xr>\n    <h2>Open Second Page</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"/second-page\" target=\"_blank\" enable-xr>\n        Open Second Page with a Link\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    {/* rest of content */}\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn the styles for `XR_ENV` mode in `src/index.css`, set different translucent materials for the backgrounds of the two card elements and the link.\n\n**CSS:**\n```css\nhtml.is-spatial {\n  background-color: transparent;\n  --xr-background-material: transparent;\n\n  .count-card {\n    --xr-background-material: thick;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n\n  .link-card {\n    --xr-background-material: translucent;\n    border-radius: 20px;\n    position: relative;\n    top: 20px;\n\n    a {\n      display: block;\n      --xr-background-material: thick;\n      border-radius: 10px;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Tip:** Although style changes take effect automatically via the Dev Server, but since the WebSpatial SDK doesn't yet support HMR for specific logic inside React components, you'll need to manually refresh the page (using the scene menu) or restart the devServer to apply those changes.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Elevate spatialized elements\n\nIn `src/App.tsx`, mark the description text inside `count-card` as a spatialized HTML element.\n\n**Code:**\n```typescript\n<p enable-xr>\n  Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to test HMR\n</p>\n```\n\nIn the styles for `XR_ENV` mode in `src/index.css`, change this element to `position: relative` and use the WebSpatial's Z-axis positioning API (`--xr-back`) to \"elevate\" it into 3D space in front of the web page plane. Also apply different levels of 'elevation' to the link elements spatialized earlier.\n\n**CSS:**\n```css\n.count-card {\n  --xr-background-material: thick;\n  position: relative;\n\n  p {\n    --xr-background-material: transparent;\n    position: absolute;\n    bottom: -10px;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    --xr-back: 20;\n  }\n}\n\n.link-card {\n  --xr-background-material: translucent;\n  border-radius: 20px;\n  position: relative;\n  --xr-back: 50;\n  top: 20px;\n}\n```\n\nAnother way to \"elevate\" is to use CSS Transform, which can also deform and rotate in 3D space.\n\nIn the styles for `XR_ENV` mode in `src/index.css`, move and rotate `link-card` along the Z axis (around the X axis):\n\n**CSS:**\n```css\n.link-card {\n  --xr-background-material: translucent;\n  border-radius: 20px;\n  position: relative;\n  --xr-back: 50;\n  top: 20px;\n  transform-origin: top left;\n  transform: translateZ(30px) rotateX(30deg);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 10. Add static 3D content\n\nTo be added\n\n---\n\n## Final result\n\nThe full source code for this demo is in the repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/webspatial/quick-example\n\nYou can either follow the steps in this article to build an identical demo project from scratch, or just clone the repo and run it using the README instructions.\n\n---\n\n## Navigation Links\n\n**Previous:** If You Are a ___ Developer\n**Next:** Core Concepts\n\n---\n\n## Footer Navigation\n\n**Learn:**\n- Introduction\n- Core Concepts\n- Quick Example\n- Video\n\n**Develop:**\n- Compatibility\n- Setup Guide\n- WebSpatial API\n\n**Community:**\n- GitHub Issues\n- Join Discord\n- FAQ\n\n**News:**\n- Blog\n- Releases\n- X\n- Events\n\n**Copyright:** Released under the MIT License.

Here is the complete analysis:\n\n---\n\n## Definitive Answer: NO — Windows Development to URL Deploy to Vision Pro Spatial Demo is NOT Currently Viable\n\nThis is the specific, evidence-based breakdown of each question.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Does WebSpatial work in the browser WITHOUT being packaged as a native visionOS app?\n\n**NO.** The official WebSpatial docs at [Unique Concepts in WebSpatial](https://webspatial.dev/docs/core-concepts/unique-concepts-in-webspatial) state explicitly:\n\n> \"A native Spatial App called the WebSpatial App Shell loads and runs the Web code. The App Shell communicates with web code through a non-standard JavaScript bridge API, handling native spatial rendering while the Web Runtime manages 2D content.\"\n\nThe spatial effects are rendered by a **native visionOS App Shell** that wraps the web content. Without that App Shell running as a packaged visionOS native app, none of the WebSpatial spatial features (depth, translucent materials, multi-scene, Z-axis positioning) activate.\n\nThe [Built on the Existing Web Ecosystem](https://webspatial.dev/docs/introduction/built-on-the-existing-web-ecosystem) page confirms: \"all other screenshots show the project running directly in regular browsers that do **not** support the WebSpatial API (including Safari on visionOS).\"\n\nSafari on Vision Pro is explicitly called out as not supporting the WebSpatial API.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Is there a \"web delivery\" mode where a URL can be opened on Vision Pro Safari and get spatial effects?\n\n**NO — not yet, and not via Safari.** The docs describe a planned future tool called the **\"WebSpatial Browser\"** — a separate native app that, if pre-installed on the Vision Pro, would allow a user to open a WebSpatial App URL and get spatial effects without a packaged app. However:\n\n- It is described as \"currently under development\" (as of the W3C TPAC meeting notes from November 2025)\n- It is **not** the built-in Vision Pro Safari browser\n- It is **not** yet available on the Vision Pro App Store\n- The W3C minutes quote: \"In our roadmap, we're planning to have web spatial browser… can open a link as a native app, browser will have SDK already… will run like the Web.\"\n\nThis is a future roadmap item, not a shipping capability.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What is the minimum that works without Mac/Xcode?\n\n**Only the web build itself — not the spatial experience.** You can do this on Windows:\n\n- Install Node.js and npm\n- Run `npm install` with `@webspatial/react-sdk`, `@webspatial/core-sdk`, etc.\n- Modify `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.app.json`\n- Run `npm run dev` (normal 2D web)\n- Run `XR_ENV=avp npm run dev` (generates the WebSpatial-specific web bundle)\n- Deploy the built output to Firebase Hosting or any static host\n\nBut the result will be a **2D website** that falls back gracefully on non-supported platforms. The spatial effects will not appear anywhere — not on Vision Pro Safari, not anywhere — without the App Shell native container.\n\nThe [Quick Example docs](https://webspatial.dev/docs/quick-example) state explicitly at Step 4:\n\n> **\"Prerequisite: a Mac computer\"**\n> \"Before using the packaging tool for WebSpatial, install Xcode and the visionOS simulator: Open the Mac App Store, search for 'Xcode', and install it.\"\n\nThe [Step 1 Install page](https://webspatial.dev/docs/development-guide/enabling-webspatial-in-web-projects/step-1-install-the-webspatial-sdk) describes `@webspatial/builder` as \"the must-have dev tool right now for developing, testing, and distributing WebSpatial apps on visionOS\" — and it requires Xcode and Mac.\n\n---\n\n### 4. What does `XR_ENV=avp` build produce — is it a web URL or a native app bundle?\n\n`XR_ENV=avp` is an **environment variable flag passed to the Vite dev server** during development. It does two things:\n\n1. It tells the Vite build to generate a WebSpatial-specific web bundle (routed to `/webspatial/avp/` instead of `/`), which is the web code that will run **inside** the native App Shell's WebView.\n2. It injects the `XR_ENV` variable into `index.html` so your code can conditionally apply spatial CSS classes (`class=\"is-spatial\"`).\n\nCritically, `XR_ENV=avp npm run dev` **does not produce the native app**. It produces a dev server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5175/webspatial/avp`) that is then consumed by the next step: `npx webspatial-builder run --base=$XR_DEV_SERVER`. That builder command is what creates and installs the **native visionOS `.ipa` package** into the visionOS Simulator — and it requires Xcode on a Mac.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Are there any examples of WebSpatial apps deployed as web URLs accessible on Vision Pro?\n\n**No public web URL examples exist that deliver spatial effects on Vision Pro.** The 7 WebSpatial apps mentioned in the W3C TPAC minutes are all **native visionOS App Store apps** built with the SDK. There are no documented examples of a plain HTTPS URL loading with spatial effects on Vision Pro — because the mechanism (the WebSpatial Browser app) does not yet exist as a shipping product.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|---|---|\n| Spatial effects work in Vision Pro Safari via URL? | NO |\n| Web URL delivery mode currently exists? | NO (roadmap only — \"WebSpatial Browser\" not yet shipped) |\n| Windows + npm can build the web bundle? | YES, but it's just a 2D fallback website |\n| Mac + Xcode required for spatial experience? | YES, explicitly required |\n| `XR_ENV=avp` produces a native .ipa? | NO — it produces a dev server URL; `webspatial-builder` (Mac/Xcode required) creates the native app |\n| Windows → Firebase URL → Vision Pro spatial demo at venue? | NO — not viable |\n\n---\n\n### What Would Actually Work\n\nThe only currently working path for a Vision Pro spatial demo is:\n\n1. Mac (Apple Silicon — M1/M2/M3 required for visionOS Simulator)\n2. Xcode with visionOS Simulator installed\n3. Run `XR_ENV=avp npm run dev` to start the WebSpatial web server\n4. Run `npx webspatial-builder run --base=<url>` to build and install the native `.ipa` into the Simulator\n\nFor a real Vision Pro device demo at a venue, you would need to either sideload via Xcode device pairing or submit to the App Store via TestFlight — both requiring a Mac and an Apple Developer account.\n\nSources:\n- [WebSpatial Quick Example](https://webspatial.dev/docs/quick-example)\n- [Unique Concepts in WebSpatial](https://webspatial.dev/docs/core-concepts/unique-concepts-in-webspatial)\n- [Step 1: Install the WebSpatial SDK](https://webspatial.dev/docs/development-guide/enabling-webspatial-in-web-projects/step-1-install-the-webspatial-sdk)\n- [WebSpatial TPAC 2025 Presentation](https://tpac2025.webspatial.dev/)\n- [W3C WebSpatial TPAC Meeting Notes, November 2025](https://www.w3.org/2025/11/10-webspatial-minutes.html)\n- [WebSpatial GitHub Repository](https://github.com/webspatial/webspatial-sdk)\n- [Built on the Existing Web Ecosystem](https://webspatial.dev/docs/introduction/built-on-the-existing-web-ecosystem)\n- [WebSpatial Home](https://webspatial.dev/)\n- [visionOS SDK requires Apple Silicon Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/09/visionos-sdk-apple-silicon-mac/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2454,"cache_read_input_tokens":37723,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2454},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYEtrsEtNJjXZuHJm3qjm","type":"assistant","uuid":"b0959e6e-dd96-48bb-b72b-80ef9ed65980","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:22:43.532Z"}
