React Native visionOS has had framework updates with 3D app demos available.\n\n**Apple's Development Framework**: Development for visionOS starts with Xcode, which supports the visionOS SDK, allowing developers to add a visionOS target to existing projects or build entirely new apps.\n\n**Web Development for Vision Pro**: The web for visionOS allows people to experience web content in a new way with a unique input model for spatial computing. Developers should design layouts with CSS viewport units and react to window resize with media and container queries.\n\n**Native Development Tools**: Developers can leverage frameworks such as Xcode, SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit, and TestFlight to craft innovative visionOS apps.\n\nThe search results indicate that while React Native is available for visionOS development, the primary toolchain Apple promotes uses SwiftUI and RealityKit. I didn't find specific information about a \"webspatial SDK\" in particular, but the results show various approaches to building spatial experiences for Vision Pro in 2024-2025.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"cae37f82-a80d-4e17-8d85-c72f396b99cd","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:59:10.276Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"77064284-43b0-45a0-969e-1670ccb3846c"}

Webhooks currently support authentication via HMAC signatures, set up by securely storing the shared secret generated upon creation of the webhook and verifying the ElevenLabs-Signature header in your endpoint using the SDK.\n\n## Knowledge Base Integration with Webhooks\n\nThe ElevenLabs documentation includes a practical guide showing how to integrate knowledge bases with webhooks. In this example using Redis, conversation state is stored to retrieve the knowledge base documents from the conversation state after the call ends.\n\nThe post-call webhook performs several steps: verifying the webhook secret and constructing the webhook payload, creating a custom voice design based on the voice_description, creating an ElevenLabs agent based on the agent_description, and retrieving the knowledge base documents from the conversation state stored in Redis to attach to the agent.\n\n## Code Example Resources\n\nFor a concrete code example, to run the app locally end-to-end, you will need to first run the Next.js development server, and then in a separate terminal run the ngrok tunnel to expose the webhook handler to the internet. The official ElevenLabs documentation provides a Next.js integration guide that demonstrates knowledge base management through webhooks.\n\nFor more detailed implementation examples, I recommend visiting the official ElevenLabs documentation pages on webhooks and their Next.js integration guide, which contain the full code samples and step-by-step instructions for setting up knowledge base webhook integrations.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4b24fa2e-4e88-45dd-a857-ca8968c9f298","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:59:25.648Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"11299737-cc0f-4d15-bb69-b3c5dbf78d35"}

It enables the entire HTML/CSS-based Web world to step into the spatial era, gaining spatial power on par with native apps (like visionOS apps) while keeping the advantages they already have.\n\n## React Integration\n\nThe WebSpatial open-source project provides a WebSpatial SDK designed for Web frameworks (for example, React + Vite), which lets Web developers immediately start using the WebSpatial API within their framework's HTML (JSX) and CSS APIs. In its first release, WebSpatial SDK offers out-of-the-box support for React projects.\n\n## Key Features\n\nThe SDK features an open standard vision extending existing HTML/CSS/JS with minimal new spatial APIs, is 2D developer friendly by extending the existing web development ecosystem, and offers zero-rewrite adoption with the ability to drop the SDK into an existing React project with zero intrusion or additional cost.\n\n## Available Resources\n\nThe main GitHub repository is at **https://github.com/webspatial/webspatial-sdk**, with documentation available at **https://webspatial.dev/**. There's also a quick example project at https://github.com/webspatial/quick-example that demonstrates WebSpatial SDK with React, TypeScript, and Vite.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"269914c1-30b1-4e11-ba7c-5d0d0e7ae693","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:59:26.118Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"78bb5a8b-867a-4c51-8db4-d3d9b06e78da"}

Multiple projects combine Flask with Firebase for real-time functionality.\n\n## Real-Time Features with Firebase\n\nFirestore is a feature provided by a service called Firebase that is a NoSQL database providing real-time implementation with almost no setup. Firestore automatically scales depending on usage without any setup.\n\nFor the Realtime Database specifically, RTDB offers the lowest latency and the simplest SDK complexity for real-time updates.\n\n## Limitations and Considerations\n\nThe search results highlight some challenges with traditional Flask backends for real-time features. When two clients use a Flask chat application at the same time, when one client sends a message, the other doesn't see the new message instantly but only sees it on refreshing the page. Web sockets, streaming, or other similar methods can make a server real-time, but these solutions might get complex.\n\n## Practical Example\n\nA Firebase realtime database hackathon starter app shows markers added/moved/removed from Firebase appearing in real time, and chat messages created on other clients synchronized in real time.\n\nThe search results don't contain specific 2025 limitations documentation, but they show that Firebase Realtime Database is generally a preferred choice for hackathons due to its simplicity in implementing real-time features compared to building custom real-time solutions with Flask.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"9c9b8bf7-b661-42c0-be91-7e0493a24c0f","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:59:44.004Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"e90859b2-89d9-46c0-ab86-0066506408b9"}

These 3D models render stereoscopically in line with other web content while allowing people to interact with the model, so people can perceive the depth of the object and move around to see different angles.\n\n## Spatial Windows and Panels\n\nApps can use windows and volumes to show content, and people can reposition these elements wherever they like. Selecting Spatial Browsing from the navigation bar transforms articles on websites that support Reader mode, removing distractions and revealing inline spatial scenes that come alive as people scroll.\n\n## 3D Capabilities and Content Types\n\nSupport has been added for playing immersive media, a new class of media that extends beyond the planar screen. Web developers have the ability to embed 3D models directly into web pages, letting users shop and browse with depth and dimension, and see and manipulate 3D objects and models right in Safari. Additionally, Web environments are a new developer preview feature that allows offering custom immersive environments to visitors through HTML markup.\n\n## 3D Limitations\n\nThe search results don't explicitly detail specific 3D limitations, though the Model element supports the USDZ file format, which may represent a format-specific constraint for web-based 3D rendering on Vision Pro.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5c79e1d4-1c82-40b4-8bdf-839e920388fb","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:59:56.183Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"e1f73a35-8490-4c3f-95d9-fc239321ca09"}

For example:\n\n```jsx\n<div className=\"card count-card\" enable-xr>\n  <button onClick={() => setCount(count => count + 1)}>\n    count is {count}\n  </button>\n</div>\n```\n\n### CSS for Spatial Features\n\nYou can also use WebSpatial's CSS API in a React project together with TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Styled Components, and similar solutions.

The container has been optimized for Llama, Mistral, Mixtral, Qwen and Jais models to include FP8 support as well as functional support for DeepSeek v3/R1 models.\n\n### Model Support and Sizes\n\nIt is highly recommended to fully leverage the high memory capacity of MI300X to run large LLMs such as Llama 3.1 405B in TP8 to maximize performance and run relatively small LLMs <= 30B on MI300X in TP1 to avoid inter-GPU communication overhead.\n\nMeta recently announced they're running 100% of their live Llama 3.1 405B model traffic on AMD MI300X GPUs. Additionally, MI300X and MI325X GPUs are capable of running the full 400B-parameter Llama 4 Maverick model in BF16 precision on a single node.\n\n## Hackathon Free Tier Limits\n\nRegarding free tier access for development and hackathons:\n\nAMD's $100 credit translates to approximately 50 hours of MI300X access at $2 per hour through their AI Developer Program, offering enterprise-grade hardware with the Instinct MI300X with 192GB of memory at no initial cost. The 2026 program expansion doubled initial allocations from earlier 25-hour offerings to accelerate development cycles.\n\nMembers who document their implementations and contribute to open-source ecosystems can request credit increases by submitting project portfolios.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d8562623-4702-4c97-a3ff-46bc9e389270","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:59:59.861Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0e7eb71a-df4a-4349-865d-0f225bcc72b3"}

However, a more recent source indicates the Free plan provides 20 monthly minutes and is intended for non-commercial experimentation.\n\n## Conversational AI Agent Pricing\n\nAgents are billed by the minute, with 10,000 credits providing about 15 minutes of AI agent time. There is no cost to create a conversational AI agent, and calls made during setup and prompt testing are billed at half the cost. The cost of calls depends on whether your agent is voice only, multimodal or text only.\n\n## Paid Plan Agent Minutes (2025)\n\nConversational AI comes with 250 minutes included on Creator, 1,100 minutes on Pro, 3,600 minutes on Scale, and up to 13,750 minutes on Business.\n\n## Recent Pricing Changes\n\nCalls now start at 10 cents per minute for Creator and Pro plans, with calls at 8 cents per minute on an annual business plan, and potentially lower on Enterprise plans (as of February 2025).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e20973b2-0707-405f-a84a-4f06cdb5c586","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:00:10.264Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"3e6ef047-0160-4d32-be6a-51ca9230be5f"}

Here's a summary of the key information:\n\n## Flask Firebase Firestore Integration\n\n### Basic Setup and Initialization\n\nTo integrate Firebase with a Python web application using Flask, you need to install Flask and the Firebase Admin SDK. The basic setup involves importing necessary modules like Flask, request, jsonify from Flask, and credentials, firestore, initialize_app from firebase_admin.\n\n### Real-Time Listeners\n\nYou can handle real-time updates in Firestore by setting up a real-time listener using the on_snapshot method, which calls a function whenever there are changes to a collection. Firestore allows you to listen for changes to documents and collections in real-time, meaning your application can automatically update whenever data changes in Firestore.\n\n### Service Account Configuration\n\nTo use Firebase in your application, you need a service account key by navigating to your Firebase project's Project Settings, then selecting Service accounts and clicking on Generate new private key, which downloads a JSON file containing your credentials.\n\n### Framework-Specific Integration\n\nFlask-Firebase-Admin is a package that allows you to connect a Firestore client directly within your Flask application using FirebaseAdmin(app) and accessing the Firestore client through firebase.firestore.client().\n\nThe search results provide practical examples for CRUD operations and basic real-time setup, though specific 2025 best practices guidelines were not extensively detailed in these results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"42678dab-1978-42c2-82fc-d25f5d5ab289","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:00:12.475Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"79641e33-021e-4f63-8af8-9bf28b25813b"}

In Xcode's \"Components\" tab, find visionOS and visionOS Simulator under \"Platform Support\", then install both.\n\n## Testing Workflow\n\nReplace the URL in your WebSpatial Builder command with the URL generated by running XR_ENV=avp npm run dev (for example: http://localhost:5175/webspatial/avp), then run: npx webspatial-builder run --base=http://localhost:5175/webspatial/avp. The visionOS simulator will automatically launch, installs the Packaged WebSpatial App, and runs it.\n\n## Key Features\n\nWebSpatial offers a Platform Simulator feature that allows you to preview and debug WebSpatial apps on visionOS simulator without a headset. Additionally, you can inspect DOM, measure performance, and live-edit styles using Safari or Chrome DevTools.\n\nThe process involves running two development servers—one for desktop/mobile platforms and another specifically for WebSpatial on visionOS, then using the WebSpatial Builder CLI to deploy and test in the simulator.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"703befd9-3779-4f4f-a37f-1fe4f2867f93","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:00:22.785Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"2fd8fcc2-b089-45d3-8e11-8070caf35375"}

Developers will need a Mac with an Apple chip to run the visionOS simulator.\n\nIn Xcode, you need to find visionOS and visionOS Simulator under \"Platform Support\" in the Components tab, then install both.\n\n## Hackathon Context\n\nFor visionOS hackathons, while Vision Pro access is highly recommended, it's not a strict requirement for participation as developers can use a Mac with an Apple chip to run the visionOS simulator, which enables meaningful participation even without the physical device.\n\n## Development Considerations\n\nYou can add the WebSpatial SDK to your web projects and use WebSpatial Builder for visionOS testing on either simulator or device. However, the WebSpatial SDK doesn't yet support HMR for specific logic inside React components, so you'll need to manually refresh the page or restart the dev server to apply those changes.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b7e059a9-7b7d-47f6-b635-498b74c2da5b","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:00:34.072Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"f3983dbb-89cc-44b2-967c-130c40a14cbc"}

Here are the key architectural patterns and implementation details:\n\n### Architecture Pattern\n\nFirebase acts as a powerful backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solution, with React handling the frontend and Firebase taking care of the backend. This eliminates the need for a custom Flask backend.\n\n### Real-Time Updates Implementation\n\nYou can listen to a document with the onSnapshot() method, which creates a document snapshot immediately with the current contents and then updates the snapshot each time contents change.\n\nWith React's useEffect hook you can setup a subscription to your Firebase Firestore database and cleanup with a call to unsubscribe.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- Firestore is a NoSQL cloud database that lets you save and share data in real-time, where updates instantly reflect across all users without manual refreshing\n\n- The snapshot handler receives a new query snapshot every time the query results change (when a document is added, removed, or modified)\n\n- Your listener can use the metadata.hasPendingWrites field on each document to determine whether it has local changes not yet written to the backend\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nReactFire provides hooks like useFirestoreDocData that allow you to subscribe to a document for real-time updates with just one line, simplifying the integration further.\n\nThis BaaS pattern with Firebase eliminates the need for a backend server like Flask, allowing you to build full-stack applications with just React and Firestore.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ab0a6dd3-b6ff-4995-bd09-cd0c0827416c","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:00:34.796Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"61ef973a-7191-425a-885b-6966d47021ee"}

Let me compile the full feasibility matrix.\n\n---\n\n# Hackathon Technical Feasibility Matrix — 22-Hour Build Assessment\n\n---\n\n## Technology 1: WebSpatial SDK (React + Apple Vision Pro)\n\n### What It Is\n\nWebSpatial is an open-source SDK that extends standard React/Vite projects with spatial computing capabilities, targeting Apple Vision Pro via visionOS. It works by adding `enable-xr` HTML attributes to JSX elements and `--xr-*` CSS custom properties, with a CLI tool (`webspatial-builder`) that packages the web app as a native visionOS app bundle.\n\n### What It Actually Renders\n\nOn Apple Vision Pro (or the visionOS Simulator), WebSpatial renders:\n- **Floating spatial panels**: Standard HTML `<div>` elements elevated into 3D space using `--xr-background-material: thick` (glass morphism effect)\n- **Z-axis depth layering**: Elements pushed forward/backward using `--xr-back` CSS and CSS `translate3d`\n- **Inline 3D models**: Via the HTML `<model>` element + USDZ file format (the only supported 3D format)\n- **Standard web UI in spatial windows**: Any React components render inside floating, repositionable visionOS windows\n\n### Time to Hello World\n\n**2–3 hours** — includes:\n1. Install Xcode + visionOS Simulator (large download, 15–30 min)\n2. `npm install @webspatial/react-sdk @webspatial/core-sdk` + configure `vite.config.ts` with the WebSpatial Vite plugin\n3. Add `jsxImportSource: \"@webspatial/react-sdk\"` to `tsconfig.json`\n4. Run two dev servers: `npm run dev` (desktop) and `XR_ENV=avp npm run dev` (visionOS target)\n5. `npx webspatial-builder run --base=http://localhost:5175/webspatial/avp` to launch in simulator\n\n### Realistic Features in 22 Hours (Team of 2–4 Freshmen)\n\nAchievable:\n- Spatially layered dashboard UI with floating cards (effort: 2 hours)\n- A React app with several panels positioned in 3D space (effort: 3 hours)\n- A 3D USDZ model embedded inline with the `<model>` tag (effort: 1 hour, finding/converting the model is the main cost)\n- Navigation between spatial views using React Router\n\nNot achievable:\n- Custom 3D interactions beyond what the HTML `<model>` element provides (no WebGL/Three.js spatial integration documented)\n- Multi-user shared spatial environments\n- Hand tracking or gesture recognition beyond the system's built-in gaze+pinch\n\n### Key Gotchas / Failure Points\n\n1. **Mac with Apple Silicon is mandatory.** The visionOS Simulator only runs on Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3/M4). If the team is on Windows or Intel Macs, this technology is completely inaccessible during the hackathon.\n2. **No Hot Module Replacement (HMR).** Every code change requires a full page refresh or server restart in the visionOS target. This slows iteration dramatically.\n3. **Two dev servers must stay in sync.** The desktop server and the visionOS target server run independently. Forgetting this causes silent mismatches.\n4. **3D models must be USDZ format.** Converting GLB/FBX/OBJ to USDZ requires either macOS tools (`Reality Composer Pro`, `usdz_converter`) or an online converter. Expect 30–60 min per model if you haven't done this before.\n5. **Early-stage SDK.** WebSpatial's GitHub README explicitly warns: \"may have bugs or missing docs/examples.\" Discord is the recommended escalation path, which is slow during a hackathon.\n6. **Testing on actual Vision Pro hardware** requires the hardware to be present at the venue and a provisioned developer profile, which adds setup friction.\n\n### Resources\n\n- GitHub: [github.com/webspatial/webspatial-sdk](https://github.com/webspatial/webspatial-sdk)\n- Quick example repo: [github.com/webspatial/quick-example](https://github.com/webspatial/quick-example)\n- Docs: [webspatial.dev/docs/quick-example](https://webspatial.dev/docs/quick-example)\n- Install guide: [webspatial.dev/docs/development-guide/enabling-webspatial-in-web-projects/step-1-install-the-webspatial-sdk](https://webspatial.dev/docs/development-guide/enabling-webspatial-in-web-projects/step-1-install-the-webspatial-sdk)\n\n---\n\n## Technology 2: AMD ROCm / Developer Cloud (AI Inference)\n\n### What It Is\n\nAMD Developer Cloud is a pay-per-hour (or free-tier) cloud service providing access to AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs (192 GB HBM3 memory per GPU). It ships Docker images preconfigured with ROCm, PyTorch, and vLLM. The free tier gives 25 GPU-hours upon approval.\n\n### Time to Hello World\n\n**3–5 hours total** — broken down as:\n- Account creation + credit application form: 15 min\n- **Approval wait: up to 3 business days.** This is the critical path killer for a hackathon. If your hackathon runs over a weekend, you may not get approved in time.\n- VM provisioning after approval: 5–10 min (pre-built Docker image)\n- First vLLM inference call (Llama 3.1 8B): 30–60 min from VM launch\n\n### What AI Inference Frameworks Run On It\n\n- **PyTorch** (ROCm-compatible, drop-in for most CUDA code)\n- **vLLM** (primary serving framework, pre-configured in Quick Start images)\n- **ONNX Runtime** (supported but less tested on ROCm)\n- **HuggingFace Transformers + Accelerate** (work with ROCm backend)\n- **SGLang, JAX, Megatron** (additional Quick Start images available)\n\n### Realistic Model Sizes in 22 Hours\n\n- **7B–13B parameter models** (Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B): Very feasible, fast inference\n- **70B models**: Feasible on a single MI300X (192 GB VRAM vs ~140 GB needed in BF16)\n- **405B models**: Requires 8x GPU node, which consumes 8 GPU-hours per clock hour (burns free credit in ~3 hours)\n\n### Realistic Features in 22 Hours\n\nAchievable (assuming account pre-approved before hackathon):\n- REST API wrapping a vLLM endpoint for LLM inference (2–3 hours)\n- Custom system prompt / persona for a chatbot backend (1 hour)\n- Streaming inference responses over HTTP SSE (2 hours)\n\nNot achievable:\n- Fine-tuning a model (requires much more setup time and GPU-hours)\n- Multi-modal models (less tested on ROCm)\n\n### Key Gotchas / Failure Points\n\n1. **3-business-day approval is the single biggest risk.** Apply at least one week before the hackathon. If your hackathon starts Friday, apply the Monday before.\n2. **VM billing continues when powered off.** You must `destroy` (not just stop) the instance to stop charges. Leaving a VM running overnight burns all 25 free hours.\n3. **CUDA code is not always a direct drop-in.** Some PyTorch CUDA extensions require ROCm-specific builds. HuggingFace models with custom CUDA kernels may fail silently.\n4. **25 hours goes fast.** A single 8x GPU node burns 8 GPU-hours per real hour. Stick to single-GPU VMs for prototyping.\n5. **Networking setup.** The VM is not publicly accessible by default; you need to configure port forwarding or a reverse proxy (ngrok works) to expose vLLM's OpenAI-compatible endpoint.\n\n### Resources\n\n- Getting started: [amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/2025/how-to-get-started-on-the-amd-developer-cloud-.html](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/2025/how-to-get-started-on-the-amd-developer-cloud-.html)\n- ROCm AI Hub: [amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/dev-ai.html](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/dev-ai.html)\n- vLLM on AMD: [blog.vllm.ai/2024/10/23/vllm-serving-amd.html](https://blog.vllm.ai/2024/10/23/vllm-serving-amd.html)\n- Developer Cloud portal: [devcloud.amd.com](https://devcloud.amd.com)\n\n---\n\n## Technology 3: ElevenLabs Conversational AI Agent\n\n### What It Is\n\nElevenLabs Agents is a managed platform that combines: fine-tuned ASR (speech-to-text), an LLM of your choice (or a custom one), ultra-low-latency TTS across 5,000+ voices and 70+ languages, and a proprietary turn-taking model.

Click \"Test AI agent\" in the dashboard — live voice conversation immediately\n5. Copy the embed snippet into your HTML to deploy to a website\n\n### Free Tier Limits\n\n- **Free plan: approximately 15–20 minutes of agent conversation time per month**\n- After that, $0.10/minute on Creator plan, $0.08/minute on Business annual\n- For a hackathon demo: 15–20 minutes is tight but sufficient for judges if managed carefully\n- Calls during testing in the dashboard are billed at **half cost**\n\n### Realistic Features in 22 Hours\n\nAchievable:\n- Custom voice agent with persona and system prompt (30 min)\n- Knowledge base from uploaded documents or URLs (1 hour) — supports PDF, DOCX, plain text, and web links\n- Post-call webhooks that fire JSON payloads to your Flask backend when a call ends (2 hours)\n- Server tools (webhooks mid-conversation) that call your API in real time to look up data (3–4 hours)\n- Embedding the widget in a React app using `@11labs/react` (1 hour)\n- Custom voice selection from ElevenLabs' voice library (30 min)\n\nNot achievable:\n- Real-time mid-call database writes from agent to Firestore (requires server tool setup, possible in 22 hours but complex)\n- Custom LLM fine-tuning\n\n### Key Gotchas / Failure Points\n\n1. **15 minutes of free tier conversation goes fast during demos.** Each judge demo burns 3–5 minutes. Plan for 3–4 demos maximum.\n2. **Latency depends on chosen LLM.** Using GPT-4o backend adds ~800ms round-trip. The built-in ElevenLabs LLM is faster.\n3. **Knowledge base is retrieval-augmented, not fine-tuned.** Very long documents with complex structure may cause poor retrieval.\n4. **Webhook testing requires a publicly accessible endpoint.** Use `ngrok` or `localtunnel` during development; do not rely on `localhost`.\n5. **Browser microphone permission** must be granted explicitly; build a clear UI affordance for this.\n\n### Workflow for Knowledge Base\n\n```\nUpload PDF/URL --> Agent ingests and chunks --> Conversational retrieval during calls\n```\n\nThe knowledge base section in the dashboard supports drag-and-drop. For dynamic knowledge bases (e.g., updated Firestore data), use server tools (webhooks) that your backend responds to with current data, injected as context mid-conversation.\n\n### Resources\n\n- Quickstart: [elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/quickstart](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/quickstart)\n- Overview: [elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/overview](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/overview)\n- Beginner's guide: [elevenlabs.io/blog/building-your-first-conversational-ai-agent-a-beginners-guide](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/building-your-first-conversational-ai-agent-a-beginners-guide)\n- Examples repo: [github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples)\n- Webhooks: [elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/workflows/post-call-webhooks](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/workflows/post-call-webhooks)\n\n---\n\n## Technology 4: Flask + Firebase (Hackathon Workshop Stack)\n\n### What It Is\n\nFlask (Python micro-framework) + Firebase (Google's BaaS: Firestore NoSQL database, Auth, Storage, Hosting). Firebase's Python Admin SDK enables server-side reads/writes; the Firebase JS SDK on the frontend enables real-time `onSnapshot` listeners without any Flask round-trips.\n\n### Time to Hello World\n\n**45–90 minutes**:\n1. `pip install flask firebase-admin` + create a Firebase project + download service account JSON: 15 min\n2. Basic Flask route writing to Firestore: 20 min\n3. React frontend reading from Firestore with `onSnapshot`: 30 min\n4. First end-to-end real-time update visible in browser: under 90 min total\n\n### Architecture Decision: Flask vs. Direct Firebase\n\nThe most important decision for a hackathon team is **whether Flask is even necessary**. For real-time updates, the React frontend talks directly to Firestore via the Firebase JS SDK:\n\n```js\n// No Flask needed for real-time updates\nimport { onSnapshot, collection } from \"firebase/firestore\";\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const unsub = onSnapshot(collection(db, \"messages\"), (snap) => {\n    setMessages(snap.docs.map(d => d.data()));\n  });\n  return unsub;\n}, []);\n```\n\nFlask IS needed for:\n- Server-side business logic (e.g., calling the AMD vLLM API, then writing results to Firestore)\n- Sensitive operations (API key management, payment processing)\n- ElevenLabs webhook endpoints\n\nFlask is NOT needed for:\n- Real-time UI updates (Firestore `onSnapshot` handles this client-side)\n- CRUD operations that don't need server-side logic\n- Authentication (Firebase Auth handles this directly)\n\n### Realistic Features in 22 Hours\n\nAchievable:\n- Full CRUD app with real-time sync across multiple browser tabs (3 hours)\n- Firebase Auth (Google OAuth login in ~1 hour using pre-built UI)\n- Flask REST API that proxies to AMD vLLM + writes results to Firestore (3 hours)\n- ElevenLabs webhook receiver in Flask that updates Firestore with conversation results (2 hours)\n- Firebase Hosting deployment (static React + Firestore, no Flask needed): `firebase deploy` (30 min)\n\nNot achievable:\n- Flask-based WebSockets (Flask does not support WebSockets natively; would need Flask-SocketIO, which adds complexity)\n\n### Key Gotchas / Failure Points\n\n1. **Flask does not do real-time by default.** Do not build polling loops in Flask when Firestore `onSnapshot` already solves the problem client-side. Teams that force real-time through Flask will waste 4–6 hours.\n2. **Service account JSON should never be committed to git.** Use `python-dotenv` and `.env` files from the start.\n3. **CORS configuration in Flask.** When the React frontend calls Flask from a different port during development, you will hit CORS errors. Install `flask-cors` and configure it in the first 30 minutes.\n4. **Firestore security rules default to \"locked\"** after project creation. If you leave rules in test mode, you get 30 days. Do not spend time on rules during a hackathon — enable test mode.\n5. **Firebase free Spark plan limits**: 1 GB Firestore storage, 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day — more than enough for a hackathon.\n\n### Resources\n\n- MLH Hackathon Flask Starter: [github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-flask-starter](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-flask-starter)\n- Flask + Firestore CRUD + Cloud Run: [medium.com/google-cloud/building-a-flask-python-crud-api-with-cloud-firestore-firebase-and-deploying-on-cloud-run-29a10c502877](https://medium.com/google-cloud/building-a-flask-python-crud-api-with-cloud-firestore-firebase-and-deploying-on-cloud-run-29a10c502877)\n- Firestore real-time with React hooks: [javascript.plainenglish.io/firebase-firestore-database-realtime-updates-with-react-hooks-useeffect-346c1e154219](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/firebase-firestore-database-realtime-updates-with-react-hooks-useeffect-346c1e154219)\n- ReactFire (hooks-based Firebase for React): [github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire)\n\n---\n\n## Technology 5: React + WebSpatial Integration Workflow\n\n### Actual Spatializing Workflow\n\nStarting from an existing React + Vite app:\n\n**Step 1 — Install packages:**\n```bash\nnpm install @webspatial/react-sdk @webspatial/core-sdk @google/model-viewer three\nnpm install -D @webspatial/builder @webspatial/platform-visionos @webspatial/vite-plugin vite-plugin-html\n```\n\n**Step 2 — Update `tsconfig.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsxImportSource\": \"@webspatial/react-sdk\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Step 3 — Update `vite.config.ts`:**\n```ts\nimport { webspatial } from \"@webspatial/vite-plugin\";\nimport { createHtmlPlugin } from \"vite-plugin-html\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    react(),\n    webspatial(),\n    createHtmlPlugin({\n      inject: { data: { XR_ENV: process.env.XR_ENV ?? \"\" } }\n    })\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n**Step 4 — Mark elements as spatial in JSX:**\n```jsx\n<div className=\"card\" enable-xr>\n  <h2>Floating Panel</h2>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Step 5 — Add spatial CSS:**\n```css\n.card {\n  --xr-background-material: thick;   /* glass panel effect */\n  --xr-back: 100px;                  /* Z-depth offset */\n}\n```\n\n**Step 6 — Run and test:**\n```bash\n# Terminal 1 (desktop preview)\nnpm run dev\n\n# Terminal 2 (visionOS target)\nXR_ENV=avp npm run dev\n\n# Terminal 3 (launch in simulator)\nnpx webspatial-builder run --base=http://localhost:5175/webspatial/avp\n```\n\n### Integration With Firebase/ElevenLabs\n\nThe spatializing step is purely additive to the React layer. Your existing `useEffect`-based Firestore `onSnapshot` subscriptions and ElevenLabs `@11labs/react` widget both work unchanged inside spatialized React components. The spatial layer is a rendering concern; the data and voice layers are unaffected.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Feasibility Matrix\n\n| Dimension | WebSpatial SDK | AMD ROCm Cloud | ElevenLabs Agent | Flask + Firebase | React + WebSpatial |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Hello World Time** | 2–3 hours | 3–5 hours (if pre-approved) | 15–30 min | 45–90 min | Adds 1–2 hours to existing React app |\n| **Pre-Hackathon Prep Required** | Yes: install Xcode + Simulator (large download) | Critical: apply 1 week early for account approval | None | None | Same as WebSpatial SDK |\n| **Hardware/OS Constraint** | Mac with Apple Silicon REQUIRED | None (cloud-based) | None | None | Same as WebSpatial |\n| **Free Tier for Hackathon** | Free (open source) | 25 GPU-hours | ~15–20 min conversation | Firebase Spark plan (generous) | Free |\n| **Biggest Risk** | Mac Silicon required; no HMR; early-stage SDK bugs | 3-day approval wait; burning hours on multi-GPU VMs | Free tier depleted by judge demos | Misusing Flask for real-time instead of Firestore | Xcode Simulator setup on day of event |\n| **Realistic 22-hour Scope** | Spatial floating UI panels, 1–2 USDZ 3D models, React navigation | LLM inference API endpoint (7B–70B), streamed responses, OpenAI-compatible API | Voice agent with persona + knowledge base + post-call webhook | Real-time multi-user data sync + auth + Flask for AI proxy endpoints | Full spatially-layered React app connected to Firebase |\n| **Freshman Friendliness** | Medium-Hard (SDK is new; two dev servers; USDZ format) | Hard (cloud infra + ROCm troubleshooting) | Very Easy (GUI dashboard) | Easy–Medium (well-documented) | Medium (once WebSpatial is understood) |\n| **Accelerator Resources** | quick-example repo; webspatial.dev docs | AMD Quick Start Docker images + vLLM JupyterLab | ElevenLabs dashboard; elevenlabs-examples GitHub | MLH Flask Starter; ReactFire | WebSpatial dev guide + existing React app |\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Build Strategy for a Freshmen Team of 2–4\n\n**Minimum viable stack (lowest risk, fully demonstrable in 22 hours):**\n\n```\nElevenLabs Agent + Firebase Firestore + React frontend\n```\n\nThis combination has no hardware constraints, under 2-hour setup for all three, and produces a live voice-interactive, real-time data-synced application that demos well to judges.\n\n**High-impact addition (add only if one person owns it end-to-end):**\n\nAdd **AMD ROCm / vLLM** as the LLM backend for the ElevenLabs agent's server tool, routing domain-specific queries through your own model. Pre-requisite: account approved before the hackathon starts.\n\n**Stretch addition (only if at least one team member has a Mac M-series):**\n\nAdd **WebSpatial** to the React frontend for the \"wow factor\" visual layer. The underlying app logic (Firestore, ElevenLabs) is unaffected. Assign one person to this full-time for the first 4 hours; if they are not in the simulator by hour 4, cut the feature.\n\n**Do not attempt:**\n- AMD ROCm without pre-approved account\n- WebSpatial without Mac Apple Silicon\n- Flask-based real-time updates (use Firestore `onSnapshot` instead)\n- ElevenLabs + AMD + WebSpatial all simultaneously without a person dedicated to each\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [WebSpatial SDK GitHub](https://github.com/webspatial/webspatial-sdk)\n- [WebSpatial Quick Example](https://webspatial.dev/docs/quick-example)\n- [WebSpatial SDK Install Guide](https://webspatial.dev/docs/development-guide/enabling-webspatial-in-web-projects/step-1-install-the-webspatial-sdk)\n- [Built on the Existing Web Ecosystem - WebSpatial](https://webspatial.dev/docs/introduction/built-on-the-existing-web-ecosystem)\n- [AMD ROCm 7 and Developer Cloud Blog](https://www.amd.com/en/blogs/2025/enabling-the-future-of-ai-introducing-amd-rocm-7-and-the-amd-developer-cloud.html)\n- [How to Get Started on AMD Developer Cloud](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/2025/how-to-get-started-on-the-amd-developer-cloud-.html)\n- [vLLM x AMD - Inference on MI300X](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/vllm-x-amd-highly-efficient-llm-inference-on-amd-instinct-mi300x-gpus.html)\n- [ElevenLabs Agents Platform Overview](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/overview)\n- [ElevenLabs Conversational AI Quickstart](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/quickstart)\n- [ElevenLabs Conversational AI 2.0](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/conversational-ai-2-0)\n- [ElevenLabs Post-Call Webhooks](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/workflows/post-call-webhooks)\n- [ElevenLabs Pricing - Agent Minutes](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/29298065878929-How-much-does-ElevenLabs-Agents-formerly-Conversational-AI-cost)\n- [MLH Hackathon Flask Starter](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-flask-starter)\n- [Firebase Firestore Real-Time with React Hooks](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/firebase-firestore-database-realtime-updates-with-react-hooks-useeffect-346c1e154219)\n- [ReactFire - Firebase Hooks for React](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire)\n- [Flask + Firestore + Cloud Run Guide](https://medium.com/google-cloud/building-a-flask-python-crud-api-with-cloud-firestore-firebase-and-deploying-on-cloud-run-29a10c502877)\n- [vLLM Serving AMD - Best Practices Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2024/10/23/vllm-serving-amd.html)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1863,"cache_read_input_tokens":31666,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1863},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYEsE9fxZAdgNHTYbSfXs","type":"assistant","uuid":"0618c665-d5fc-4bd0-9318-6b2de386b374","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:02:49.216Z"}
