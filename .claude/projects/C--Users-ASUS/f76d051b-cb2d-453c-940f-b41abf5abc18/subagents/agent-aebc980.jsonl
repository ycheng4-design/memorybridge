The SDK enables several spatial features:\n\n- Breaking the crowded, solid-backed web page into independent panels that hover in space, removing the frame so translucent UI lives naturally over the real world\n- Moving any HTML element off the flat page to position or reshape it along the Z-axis, giving your interface true depth beyond width and height\n- Composing web apps from multiple OS-managed flat or volumetric scenes and introducing volumetric 3D elements that nest and layout seamlessly with 2D elements\n\n## Examples and Resources\n\nA quick example is available that provides a minimal demonstration to get a quick feel for the actual results and development experience of the WebSpatial SDK, covering project setup, SDK installation and configuration, a sample development workflow, and a preview of spatial features. A sample project is available at https://github.com/webspatial/sample-techshop.\n\n## SDK Components\n\nThe WebSpatial API includes Spatialization, Material, Elevation, Scenes, and 3D capabilities. In its first release, WebSpatial SDK offers out-of-the-box support for React projects, though WebSpatial also offers a framework-agnostic Core SDK composed solely of pure JS APIs.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"05eac6d7-a00a-4aff-b95b-d6bf4bc85849","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:58:48.613Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"6b2492ba-69b4-4908-8274-19afec260240"}

Focus on a Single Strong Idea**\nFocus on one strong idea, and limit yourself to at most three well-executed features—simplicity wins. What you need is a single feature that your application focuses on and does extremely well, as the winning submissions are projects that have a single idea that is coherent, defined, and well-implemented.\n\n**2. Build a Diverse Team with Clear Roles**\nPick individuals who are dedicated, present during the hackathon, and possess complementary expertise. Assign each person a clear, distinct task and make sure to keep in check regularly with other team members what parts they are working on.\n\n**3. Understand the Hackathon Requirements**\nStart by reading the guidelines, rules, problem statements, and judging rubrics carefully—knowing what judges look for will definitely give you a head start.\n\n**4. Prepare Your Pitch Early**\nWhile coding is happening, always keep refining your pitch, record draft presentations, gather feedback from your teammates, and practice the timing—the pitch can make or break your chances.\n\n**5. Master the Basics, Not Complexity**\nMost of the things you will be doing in a Hackathon will be code that someone else has already written—search online first before writing anything.\n\n**6. Plan Your Project Before Coding**\nWrite down your idea in the form of a one-pager describing the problem you are about to solve, your innovative solution, your assumptions, and the technologies involved.\n\nRemember, hacking your first hackathon isn't about being the greatest coder in the room—it's about collaboration, planning, simplicity, and hustle.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a6e5edfb-3d3e-4a1e-bcab-7e0be7d0f972","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:59:11.364Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"3570794e-bdeb-4e0d-abf5-98b1159ac914"}

The platform offers comprehensive APIs for TTS, STT, Voice Cloning, Voice Changer, and Conversational AI, with Python & TypeScript SDKs, detailed docs, and GDPR & SOC II compliance.\n\nAgents listen, read and interact just like humans would across phone, chat, email and WhatsApp. Standard generation takes 1-3 seconds, while the Flash v2.5 model achieves sub-200ms latency for real-time apps like conversational AI and live streaming.\n\n## Voice Cloning\n\nStarting with the Starter plan, ElevenLabs enables users to clone voices with minimal input, allowing them to create personalized and branded audio outputs. Instant voice cloning is typically introduced at the Starter plan, while Professional voice cloning becomes available at the Creator tier.\n\n## Pricing Structure\n\nElevenLabs offers a free trial and starts at $5/month for AI-powered text-to-speech and voice cloning. Different services consume credits at varying rates; for example, standard TTS models cost 1 credit per character, while Turbo models are 0.5 credits, and Conversational AI Agents are billed by the minute.\n\n## Free Tier\n\nElevenLabs has a free plan, but it is limited to 10,000 credits per month, which translates into only 10 minutes of text-to-speech or 15 minutes of conversational AI generation. The free tier is for personal use only.\n\n## Pricing Simplification (2025)\n\nBy August 2025, ElevenLabs simplified its pricing by unifying character credits again regardless of model (Multilingual or Flash). Plans became more transparent with each tier clearly defining how many characters you could use, what models you had access to, and how many voice slots, cloning credits, and dubbing entitlements were included.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d053445b-4160-4527-bf21-95b7632018a1","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:59:27.503Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"a3d517ff-f045-4cba-aab0-345fca60e3c6"}

It can drop into existing React projects with zero intrusion and supports cross-platform development across desktops, mobiles, and spatial-computing platforms.\n\n## Hackathon Activity\n\nA hackathon event called \"Web to Spatial\" showed that 95% of developers have no issue following the \"Quick Example\" to start a WebSpatial app. Real apps built using WebSpatial were created solo in a little over a week of spare time.\n\n## VisionOS Support\n\nRight now there are 7 apps in Apple VisionPro store built with WebSpatial SDK.

More specifically, a great hackathon idea should wow both judges and other hackers, and while a completely novel idea is great, a fresh approach to an old problem can be just as impressive.\n\nImplementation matters—how well your team develops the prototype, and the polishness of your work can offer extra conviction for the judges to pick you. Additionally, judges consider the impact or value of the idea—how your idea could change the world.\n\n## Tips for Freshman Teams to Win\n\nAn inspiring example of freshman success: A team of Mason freshmen won Best Overall prize at HooHacks, bringing home more than $500 in prizes and an invitation to compete at Pinnacle, the most competitive collegiate hackathon worldwide. Although only freshmen, the teammates had an existing relationship from a high school robotics team, and their project was an Alarm System Network using machine learning to identify gunshots and alert community members.\n\nThe best way to impress hackathon judges is to brainstorm around latest technologies (AI, blockchain, fintech, MedTech, IoT), latest trends, and latest issues. Successful teams emphasize that teamwork is the backbone of any successful project, and knowing how to leverage team members' strengths and expertise is the real key to success.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8f1e4b73-e115-4177-a834-06d97bf7effd","timestamp":"2026-02-18T03:59:43.323Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0485621a-7ceb-40be-9572-35a121347314"}

AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) tools are transforming crisis communication by enabling real-time translations of medical instructions. AI-driven natural language processing tools enable real-time translations of medical instructions, public health advisories, and emergency alerts into multiple languages. AI chatbots are also being used to bridge language barriers, ensuring that displaced individuals receive accurate health information in their native languages.\n\n## Mental Health and Psychosocial Support\n\nArtificial Intelligence is playing a crucial role in providing mental health support for displaced individuals. AI-powered counseling bots, such as those developed by Wysa and Woebot, offer psychological assistance to refugees and disaster survivors suffering from trauma, stress, and anxiety. These chatbots utilize artificial intelligence to provide support through techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness exercises, offering immediate assistance in multiple languages.\n\n## Healthcare Applications\n\nRefugee camps are benefiting from AI-driven telemedicine solutions. Tools like the Children's Immunization App (CIMA) help clinics track vaccination schedules and send automated reminders to parents in settings like Zaatari refugee camp.\n\n## 2026 Humanitarian AI Trends\n\nA recent survey revealed what has been called the 'humanitarian AI paradox': widespread individual adoption outpacing organisational readiness, with 93% of humanitarians using AI tools but only 8% working in organisations with fully integrated AI strategies. An upcoming humanitarian AI webinar will explore current trends in AI adoption within the humanitarian sector, with practitioners discussing effective strategies, challenges, and key lessons to inform future AI initiatives, providing practical insights into real-world applications.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"08d16c11-600c-4235-833b-73f06c248610","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:00:14.206Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"e1642307-2dcc-49c0-9ffb-251c12488600"}

Let me compile this into a thorough strategic briefing.\n\n---\n\n# Hackathon Strategy Intelligence Report\n\n## 1. AMD Developer Cloud\n\n### What the Technology Can Do\n\nAMD's developer ecosystem for hackathons centers on three pillars:\n\n**Hardware Access:** AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs (192GB VRAM) are available via the AMD Developer Cloud. Participants get free compute credits during hackathons. ROCm 7 (released 2025) delivers 3.5x the inference capability and 3x the training speed of ROCm 6. The stack runs on everything from Ryzen AI laptops to MI300X datacenter GPUs.\n\n**Software Stack (ROCm):** An open software stack covering programming models, compilers (HIP), libraries (rocBLAS, MIOpen), and runtimes. Fully compatible with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face. As of ROCm 7, Windows is a first-class supported OS.\n\n**On-Device / Edge AI:** AMD Ryzen AI NPUs in laptops run local LLMs. The Hack The Edge event showed teams running Liquid Foundation Models (LFM2, 350M-1.5B parameter range) on AMD NUC mini-PCs with zero cloud calls — real on-device inference.\n\n**Free Tier:** AMD has given away 100,000 hours of free Developer Cloud access to researchers. Hackathon participants historically receive direct GPU access plus AMD AI Developer Program membership which includes free credits, monthly GPU sweepstakes, and training.\n\n### What Has Won / Impressed AMD\n\nFrom the 2024 AMD Pervasive AI Developer Contest (three categories: Generative AI, Robotics AI, PC AI):\n\n- **1st place Generative AI: \"Mather\"** — A fine-tuned Mistral model that helps students solve math problems. Simple, educational, clear social impact, ran on AMD hardware.\n- **2nd place Generative AI: Anime character creator** — Creative tool with customized looks and video output, running locally.\n- **3rd place Generative AI: \"Storyteller\"** — Interactive AI-generated adventure fantasy story creator.\n- **PC AI category** focused on NPU utilization on Ryzen AI laptops.\n\nFrom the **Hack The Edge hackathon (2025)**, 15 teams in 48 hours impressed AMD with:\n- **Liquid DJ:** On-device Shazam for DJ sets (audio model, no cloud).\n- **Liquid Audio Book:** OCR + text refinement + TTS pipeline, fully offline.\n- **GrocerDaddy:** Grocery aisle object detection on a tiny 450M multimodal model.\n- **VoltX:** On-device EV battery health monitor.\n\n**Pattern of What AMD Engineers Love:**\n1. Demonstrating that AMD hardware can do what people assume only NVIDIA can do\n2. Privacy-first / on-device use cases (no cloud calls is a major selling point)\n3. Real-world utility — not demos for demos' sake, but actual tools (home health assistants, meeting recorders, bug detection, document Q&A)\n4. Using ROCm stack correctly (HIP, ROCm-native libraries) rather than just running generic PyTorch\n5. Educational and social impact applications score well (Mather won 1st)\n6. Fine-tuning and optimization on AMD hardware specifically\n\n**Technical Constraints:**\n- Easy: Running any HuggingFace model via ROCm-compatible PyTorch, building a RAG pipeline, running vLLM on MI300X\n- Medium: Fine-tuning (doable in 22 hours on MI300X with small models and LoRA)\n- Hard: Custom CUDA-to-HIP kernel porting, distributed training, robotics integration\n\n**The $160,000 AMD Pervasive AI Developer Contest (2026)** is currently active with $10,000 per category winner and free hardware grants.\n\n---\n\n## 2. WebSpatial SDK (ByteDance)\n\n### What the Technology Can Do\n\nWebSpatial is an open-source SDK from ByteDance that extends standard web (HTML/CSS/React) into spatial computing, primarily targeting Apple Vision Pro (visionOS). Key capabilities:\n\n- **Zero intrusion into existing React apps** — Add spatial features to any existing React project with minimal code changes\n- **Spatialized UI** — Break flat web pages into floating panels that hover in 3D space, with real-world pass-through backgrounds (no opaque page backdrop)\n- **Z-axis depth** — Move any HTML element off a flat plane and position it in 3D space\n- **Volumetric 3D elements** — Embed 3D objects that coexist and lay out with 2D DOM elements\n- **Multiple OS-managed scenes** — Compose multi-window/multi-panel spatial app architectures\n- **Cross-platform:** One codebase = 2D on desktop/mobile, full spatial on visionOS devices\n\n**APIs include:** Spatialization, Material, Elevation, Scenes, and 3D composition.\n\n**Installation:** `npm install @webspatial/core-sdk` or the React-specific package. There is a framework-agnostic Core SDK (pure JS) and a React SDK.\n\n**Maturity signal:** 7 apps already in the Apple Vision Pro App Store built with WebSpatial. Presented at W3C TPAC 2025. At a recent \"Web to Spatial\" hackathon, 95% of developers successfully followed the Quick Example with no issues.\n\n**What Impresses ByteDance / WebSpatial:**\n- Demos that feel native-quality but are built with web tech\n- Spatial interfaces that aren't just a flat webpage floating in air — they use actual depth and multiple panels\n- Real utility: spatial data visualization, educational tools in 3D, health/fitness apps with depth\n- Showcasing how a web developer with no visionOS experience can ship a spatial app quickly\n\n**Technical Constraints:**\n- Easy: Adding spatial depth to an existing React app, floating panels, 3D positioning\n- Medium: Multi-scene spatial workflows, integrating 3D model assets\n- Hard: Building from scratch on visionOS without the SDK; the SDK specifically solves this\n- Constraint: Requires access to Apple Vision Pro hardware or the visionOS Simulator (Xcode on a Mac)\n\n---\n\n## 3. ElevenLabs Conversational AI\n\n### What the Technology Can Do\n\nElevenLabs offers a full voice AI platform, not just TTS:\n\n**Conversational AI Agents:** Configure, deploy, and monitor natural-sounding voice agents in 32 languages. Agents listen, process, and respond in real-time with sub-200ms latency using Flash v2.5. They work across phone, chat, email, and WhatsApp. Full Python and TypeScript SDKs.\n\n**Voice Cloning:** Instant voice cloning from minimal audio input (Starter plan). Professional voice cloning with higher fidelity at Creator tier.\n\n**TTS Models:** Standard (1-3 second generation), Turbo (sub-200ms, 0.5 credits/char), Flash v2.5 (real-time grade). 10,000+ voices in 70+ languages.\n\n**APIs:** TTS, STT, Voice Cloning, Voice Changer, and Conversational AI. Full REST API + SDKs. GDPR and SOC II compliant.\n\n**Free Tier:** 10,000 credits/month = ~10 minutes TTS or 15 minutes conversational AI. Enough for demos, tight for a polished hackathon product. Paid starts at $5/month.\n\n### What Has Won / Impressed ElevenLabs\n\nFrom the ElevenLabs Worldwide Hackathon (February 2025, 300+ projects, 40 hours, co-hosted with a16z, Balderton):\n\n- **Global Winner: GibberLink** (Boris Starkov, Anton Pidkuiko) — A protocol that lets voice agents detect when they're talking to another AI agent and switch to hyper-efficient data-over-sound mode. Went viral on social media, picked up by Forbes and MKBHD. This won because it was technically novel at the protocol level, not just an app layer.\n- **Runner-up: Espresso Labs** — Voice-first personal assistant\n- **Hugo Tour Guide** — Conversational travel companion with route planning, local insights, and location awareness. 4-person team, impressively feature-rich. Won a regional top slot.\n- **Vox Populi** — 3D sandbox game where you interact with AI agents via speech. Creative, novel UI paradigm.\n- **PrintMoneyAI** — Conversational project management agent\n- **DeepSky (Warsaw)** — Voice AI agent for airspace safety (social good + real-world utility)\n- **Claimsio (Warsaw)** — Automated debt collection via voice\n- **lossfunk (Bangalore)** — AI film generator from voice\n- **ECHO AI (Bangalore)** — Turns scattered voice thoughts into organized data\n- **Pochinki (Bangalore)** — Seamlessly integrates ads into podcasts via voice\n\n**Pattern of What ElevenLabs Judges Love:**\n1. Novel use of voice as the primary/only interaction modality (not voice bolted on)\n2. Multi-agent voice architectures (agent-to-agent communication, multi-speaker)\n3. Real-world practical tools, not toy demos\n4. Cross-language / multilingual reach (ElevenLabs supports 32 languages — demos that use this get attention)\n5. Low latency, real-time conversation feels (sub-200ms Flash model)\n6. Social good: DeepSky (airspace safety) won in Warsaw — voice AI for high-stakes domains impresses\n7. Viral demo potential (GibberLink shows that a novel technical concept that looks amazing in a 30-second clip has outsized judging power)\n\n**Technical Constraints:**\n- Easy: TTS integration, basic conversational agent with ElevenLabs Conversational AI SDK\n- Medium: Multi-turn memory, real-time streaming, custom voice persona with cloned voice\n- Hard: Sub-100ms latency with custom STT pipeline, phone integration (requires Twilio or similar)\n\n---\n\n## 4. CrowdStrike\n\n### What the Technology Can Do\n\nCrowdStrike's Falcon Platform offers a developer API surface at [developer.crowdstrike.com](https://developer.crowdstrike.com):\n\n**Falcon APIs include:**\n- Alerts, hosts, and incident data retrieval\n- Threat hunting across normalized security telemetry (hosts, detects, alerts, incidents)\n- Identity security data\n- AI Detection and Response (Falcon AIDR, GA 2025) — detects AI-specific attacks and shadow AI\n- Data Protection APIs — detect sensitive data in GenAI prompts, block uploads to AI models\n\n**Charlotte AI (CrowdStrike's own AI analyst):** An agentic SOC analyst that can investigate alerts, triage threats, and suggest responses. This represents CrowdStrike's agentic AI direction as of Fal.Con 2025.\n\n**SDK Languages:** JavaScript, Python, Go, PowerShell, Rust, Ruby.\n\n**CrowdStrike + AWS + NVIDIA 2026 Accelerator:** Selected 35 startups for cybersecurity innovation — focus areas were cloud security, agentic AI for SOC, AI security tools.\n\n**What CrowdStrike Favors:**\nCrowdStrike's explicit 2025-2026 strategic focus is \"Agentic SOC\" — autonomous AI agents that detect, investigate, and respond to threats. Their sponsored 2025 Accelerator winner was **Terra Security**, which does autonomous AI-powered web application penetration testing. The pattern is clear: autonomous, agentic security tooling that reduces human analyst workload.\n\nFor social good framing, CrowdStrike's community initiatives (via their sustainability page) emphasize NextGen cybersecurity education — so projects that democratize security education, make threat analysis accessible to non-experts, or protect vulnerable populations (nonprofits, schools, NGOs) from cyber threats would align well.\n\n**What Would Win a CrowdStrike-Sponsored Category:**\n- An AI agent that auto-triages security alerts using Falcon API data\n- A tool that detects AI prompt injection or shadow AI use in an organization (using Falcon AIDR APIs)\n- Cybersecurity education tools for underserved communities (schools, NGOs)\n- Autonomous penetration testing or vulnerability scanning (like Terra Security)\n\n**Technical Constraints:**\n- Requires a Falcon console login — access is not trivially self-service for hackathon participants without pre-arranged credentials. This is a significant practical barrier.\n- Easy (with credentials): Querying alert/detection APIs, building dashboards, integrating with Python SDK\n- Hard: Real-time telemetry streaming, building anything that requires actual endpoint agents deployed\n\n---\n\n## 5. \"Best Freshman Hack\" Strategy\n\n### What the Category Typically Rewards\n\n\"Best Freshman Hack\" is a common MLH (Major League Hacking) category at collegiate hackathons, designed specifically to level the playing field for first-year students. Judges calibrate expectations to experience level but still reward:\n\n1. **Surprising ambition relative to experience** — A team that built something working and polished when nobody expected it.\n2. **Clear narrative:** \"We had no idea what we were doing 10 hours ago, and now we have this\" is extremely compelling.\n3. **A single, well-executed idea** — Judges penalize scope creep. The winning project does one thing extremely well.\n4. **Emotional storytelling in the pitch** — Freshman teams that pitch like they understand the problem deeply (personal motivation, lived experience with the issue) win over teams with fancier tech.\n5. **Working demo over polished slides** — A demo that crashes kills freshman teams. Fake the hard parts if needed; use pre-recorded video for flaky components.\n\n**Real-World Example:** A team of Mason freshmen won Best Overall at HooHacks with a gunshot detection system using ML — they had a prior relationship from a robotics team, assigned clear roles, and had a working demo.\n\n**Freshman-Optimized Tech Stack (22 hours):**\n- Python + Flask/FastAPI backend (familiar, lots of tutorials)\n- Streamlit for instant UI (no frontend knowledge required)\n- OpenAI / ElevenLabs / HuggingFace APIs (high-level, well-documented)\n- Replit or Vercel for instant deployment (judges need to access it)\n- Pre-built models via HuggingFace Inference API (no GPU required)\n\n**The 22-Hour Scope Rule:**\n- Hours 0-2: Idea lock + architecture decision (do not skip this)\n- Hours 2-16: Build core feature only — one API call that works, one UI screen\n- Hours 16-20: Polish the demo path specifically (not the whole app)\n- Hours 20-22: Practice pitch out loud 3+ times\n\n**What freshman teams should NOT attempt in 22 hours:**\n- Fine-tuning any model\n- Building a mobile app (unless team has React Native experience)\n- Real-time multi-user collaboration\n- Complex authentication flows\n- Scraping/crawling as a data source (too flaky)\n\n---\n\n## 6. AI + Social Good Trends for 2026\n\n### Dominant Themes Winning Hackathons Right Now\n\n**1. Mental Health + Accessibility**\nThe APA reports AI/neuroscience are converging on personalized mental health care (January 2026). Projects using voice AI for mental health coaching (therapy-adjacent, not therapy) are extremely fundable and win social good categories. Think: anonymous voice journaling with AI feedback, crisis text line enhancement, mood detection.\n\n**2. Language Access for Marginalized Communities**\n93% of humanitarian organizations report individual AI adoption outpacing organizational readiness. Real pain points: refugee camps need multilingual health communication, immigrant communities need document translation, elderly populations need voice-native interfaces. Projects bridging language gaps with voice AI (ElevenLabs + multilingual support) score well.\n\n**3. AI for Education Equity**\nSDG 4 (Quality Education) was the second most common theme in 2025 global AI hackathon submissions. Winning projects: AI tutors for multi-grade rural classrooms, math problem helpers (like AMD's winning \"Mather\"), tools for teachers managing resource-scarce environments.\n\n**4. Health Systems Innovation**\nHarvard HSIL Hackathon 2026 is explicitly focused on \"Building High-Value Health Systems: Leveraging AI.\" SDG 3 (Good Health) was the most common 2025 hackathon theme. Winning angle: not replacing doctors, but extending reach — AI triaging in under-resourced clinics, vaccination tracking, chronic disease self-monitoring.\n\n**5. Disaster Response and Environmental Resilience**\nLess explored = more originality. Voice AI for emergency response coordination, real-time multilingual disaster alerts, AI for wildfire evacuation routing.\n\n**6. Cybersecurity for Underserved Organizations**\nCrowdStrike's framing: nonprofits, schools, and small NGOs are cyber targets but have zero security budgets. A tool that gives them Falcon-grade threat visibility for free or cheap = perfect CrowdStrike + social good fusion.\n\n**7. Agentic AI (the Meta-Trend)**\nEvery sponsor — AMD (agentic edge apps), ElevenLabs (conversational agents), CrowdStrike (agentic SOC) — is pushing toward autonomous multi-step AI. A project with an \"agent\" that autonomously takes steps (rather than just generating a single output) will resonate across all sponsor categories.\n\n---\n\n## Synthesis: The Ideal Multi-Sponsor Hackathon Project\n\nBased on all patterns above, here is the archetype that maximizes multi-sponsor appeal in 22 hours:\n\n**Core concept:** A voice-first, multilingual conversational AI agent for a clearly underserved population (refugees, elderly, disaster survivors, non-English speakers) that runs efficiently and has a compelling spatial/visual interface.\n\n**How it maps to each sponsor:**\n- **ElevenLabs:** Voice conversational agent is the literal product; multilingual support shows off their 32-language capability; low-latency Flash model\n- **AMD:** Backend inference runs on AMD Developer Cloud (any open model via ROCm-compatible vLLM); demonstrate on-device privacy angle\n- **WebSpatial:** A spatial 3D dashboard or information overlay for the caregiver/administrator side — built in React with WebSpatial SDK\n- **CrowdStrike:** If the app handles sensitive personal data, frame the security model; or build in a \"threat detection\" component for phishing/scam alerts targeting the vulnerable population\n- **Best Freshman Hack:** Keep the user-facing interface to a single conversation flow; the emotional story (\"we wanted to help [group] that our families belong to\") is authentic and powerful\n- **Social Good:** The problem space (language access, elderly care, refugee health) directly maps to SDG 3 and SDG 4 and the 2026 humanitarian AI trends\n\n**Technical stack that is achievable in 22 hours by a freshman team:**\n- ElevenLabs Conversational AI SDK (Python or TypeScript) for the voice agent\n- A lightweight open-source LLM (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B) running on AMD Developer Cloud via vLLM\n- React frontend with WebSpatial SDK for the admin/caregiver dashboard\n- FastAPI or Express.js backend\n- Streamlit or simple HTML for the end-user voice interface\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Hack The Edge: AMD and Liquid AI Hackathon
