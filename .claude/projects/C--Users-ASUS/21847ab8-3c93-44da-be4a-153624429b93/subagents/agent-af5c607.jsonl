You have roughly 3 seconds before a founder decides \"spam\" or \"interesting.\" The data is clear: personalization is the single highest-leverage variable. Not \"Hi {first_name}\" personalization -- that is worse than no personalization because it signals automation. I mean *contextual* personalization: referencing something specific the founder did, built, or said. The message needs to pass what I call the \"screenshot test\" -- if this founder screenshots your DM and posts it, does it make you look good or terrible?\n\nMy proposed structure: **Observation + Connection + Low-Friction Ask.**\n\nExample: *\"Saw your demo of [product] at [event/on Twitter] -- the way you approached [specific thing] is clever. We built PitchTok to help founders like you get discovered by investors through 90-sec pitch videos. Would you be open to checking it out?\"*\n\n**Ethics & Trust Advocate:**\n\nI need to push back immediately. \"Founders like you\" is a red flag phrase. Every founder has received fifty messages saying \"founders like you.\" It is a tell that you are running a playbook. More importantly, let us address the elephant in the room: **this is an AI agent sending these messages.** Are we disclosing that? Because if a founder has a seemingly genuine conversation and later discovers it was a bot, you have not just lost one user -- you have created an enemy who will tell every founder they know.\n\nI propose we must disclose the AI nature within the first two exchanges. Not necessarily the opener, but before any real rapport is built. Anything less is deceptive. And deception does not scale -- it compounds into reputational debt.\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nYou are both partly right and partly wrong, and I have the numbers to prove it. Let me lay out what cold outreach data actually shows:\n\n| Variable | Impact on Response Rate |\n|---|---|\n| Personalization (genuine, specific) | +140% vs generic |\n| AI disclosure upfront | -35% response rate |\n| AI disclosure after 2 exchanges | -8% response rate |\n| Message under 50 words | +60% vs 100+ words |\n| Question ending | +22% vs statement ending |\n| Mentioning mutual connection | +85% |\n\nThe Ethics Advocate's proposal of immediate AI disclosure would cost us over a third of responses. But here is where I agree with them: deferred disclosure (after 2 exchanges) barely hurts conversion and prevents the reputational catastrophe they described. The real conversion killer is not the AI -- it is **length**. Every word past 50 in the opener costs you. Sales Expert, your example is 43 words. That is close to optimal but could be tighter.\n\n**Ethics & Trust Advocate:**\n\nI am uncomfortable with that framing. You are treating \"when to disclose we are an AI\" as an optimization variable. These are real people. The question is not \"what loses fewer conversions\" -- it is \"what is honest.\" If a founder asks \"are you a real person?\" at any point, the answer must be immediate and unambiguous. And I would argue the profile or bio should make the AI nature clear even if the first message does not state it.\n\n**Sales Psychology Expert:**\n\nI actually agree with that compromise. The profile bio can say something like \"AI-powered outreach for PitchTok\" -- then the founder can see it if they check, but the message itself can focus on value. This is how most sales development tooling works now. The SDR's LinkedIn says they are an SDR. Nobody pretends otherwise.\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nAgreed. Profile transparency plus natural conversation flow. Let us codify this and move on to what the opening messages should actually look like per platform.\n\n---\n\n## ROUND 2: PLATFORM-SPECIFIC OPENERS\n\n---\n\n**Sales Psychology Expert:**\n\nEach platform has a different \"native language.\" A message that works on LinkedIn will feel jarring on Twitter/X, and both would be alien on XHS (Xiaohongshu) or Reddit. The key principle: **match the register of the platform.**\n\n- **LinkedIn:** Professional, slightly formal, can be longer. Founders expect business outreach here.\n- **Twitter/X:** Casual, short, almost conversational. Often better to engage with their content publicly first, then DM.\n- **Reddit:** Community-first. Direct promotion gets you banned or ignored. Must lead with value.\n- **XHS:** Visual, community-oriented, different cultural norms around directness.\n\n**Ethics & Trust Advocate:**\n\nI want to flag something about the \"engage publicly first, then DM\" strategy on Twitter. If an AI is liking and replying to a founder's tweets to manufacture familiarity before sliding into DMs, that is a form of social engineering. It is qualitatively different from a human who genuinely follows someone and then reaches out. We need guardrails here.\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nPractically speaking, the \"warm-up engagement\" approach converts 2-3x better than cold DMs on Twitter. But I take the Ethics point. Here is my compromise: the AI should only reference content it has genuinely analyzed and found relevant. No fake engagement. No liking 15 tweets to create a notification trail. One genuine public reply that adds value, followed by a DM if the founder engages back. That is the ethical version of warm outreach.\n\n**Sales Psychology Expert:**\n\nFair. Let me draft the openers.\n\n---\n\n### Opening Message Templates\n\n**LINKEDIN (3 variants)**\n\n**L1 -- The Specific Observer:**\n> Hi [Name] -- saw [specific thing: your launch on ProductHunt / your talk at YC Demo Day / your Series A announcement]. What you are building with [company] is interesting. Quick question: have you explored short-form video to get in front of investors? We built PitchTok for exactly that. Worth 2 min of your time?\n\n**L2 -- The Mutual Context:**\n> Hi [Name] -- [mutual connection / shared accelerator / same investor network] led me to your profile. PitchTok helps founders get discovered by investors through 90-second pitch videos. Given what you are building, thought it might be relevant. Open to a quick look?\n\n**L3 -- The Direct Value:**\n> Hi [Name] -- founders in [their space: fintech / healthtech / climate] are getting investor meetings through PitchTok pitch videos. Your work on [company] seems like a fit. Want me to send a 60-second overview?\n\n**TWITTER / X (3 variants)**\n\n**T1 -- The Reply-First:**\n> [Public reply to their tweet adding genuine insight or asking a smart question. If they engage:]\n> DM: \"Hey -- enjoyed that thread. Random question: have you seen founders using 90-sec pitch videos to get investor attention? Built something around that, thought you might find it interesting.\"\n\n**T2 -- The Cold Short:**\n> \"Hey [Name] -- been following what you are building with [company]. Built PitchTok for founders to get discovered by investors via 90-sec videos. Think it could be useful for you. Cool if I share a quick link?\"\n\n**T3 -- The Peer Frame:**\n> \"Yo -- saw your [product/tweet/launch]. We are working on something adjacent for founders: investor discovery through short pitch videos. Would love your take on it honestly, even if it is not for you.\"\n\n**REDDIT (2 variants -- Reddit requires extreme care)**\n\n**R1 -- The Community Member:**\n> [In relevant subreddit thread where founder is active:]\n> \"This is a great point about [topic]. Tangentially related -- we have been working on PitchTok, where founders upload 90-sec pitch videos and investors discover them. Curious what this community thinks about that format for fundraising.\"\n\n**R2 -- The Direct DM (only after public interaction):**\n> \"Hey -- saw your comments in r/[subreddit]. You clearly know [space] well. We built PitchTok for founder-investor discovery through short videos. Would genuinely value your perspective, even if it is just feedback.\"\n\n**XHS / Xiaohongshu (2 variants)**\n\n**X1 -- The Cultural Bridge (in Chinese):**\n> \"[Name]你好！看到你在[领域]的项目，很有意思。我们做了PitchTok -- 创业者上传90秒路演视频，投资人来发现项目。想了解一下吗？\"\n> (Translation: \"Hi [Name]! Saw your project in [field], very interesting. We built PitchTok -- founders upload 90-sec pitch videos, investors discover them. Want to learn more?\")\n\n**X2 -- The Founder-to-Founder:**\n> \"在小红书看到你分享的创业经历，很真实。PitchTok专门帮创业者通过短视频被投资人发现，觉得可能对你有帮助。方便聊两句吗？\"\n> (Translation: \"Saw your startup story on XHS, very authentic. PitchTok specifically helps founders get discovered by investors through short videos. Might be helpful for you. Have a moment to chat?\")\n\n**Ethics & Trust Advocate:**\n\nThese are reasonable. My remaining concern is the Reddit approach. Reddit communities are notoriously hostile to self-promotion. R1 is borderline -- it could be perceived as astroturfing. I would add a rule: **never post in a subreddit where PitchTok has not been organically mentioned by someone else first**, or be completely transparent that you are affiliated.\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nAgreed. Reddit is low-volume, high-risk. It should be deprioritized compared to LinkedIn and Twitter, which together account for 80%+ of reachable founders. I would allocate effort accordingly: LinkedIn 50%, Twitter 35%, Reddit 10%, XHS 5% (unless targeting Chinese founders specifically, then flip XHS to 40%).\n\n---\n\n## ROUND 3: RESPONSE HANDLING -- THE BRANCHING LOGIC\n\n---\n\n**Sales Psychology Expert:**\n\nThis is where most AI outreach fails catastrophically. The opener might be good, but the second message reveals the bot. Here is my taxonomy of founder responses and the psychological state behind each:\n\n| Response Type | Psychological State | What They Actually Mean |\n|---|---|---|\n| Interested (\"Tell me more\") | Curious but guarded | \"Prove this is worth my time\" |\n| Skeptical (\"What is this really?\") | Defensive, been burned before | \"I have seen 100 of these\" |\n| Busy (\"Not right now\") | Genuinely time-poor | \"Maybe real, but low priority\" |\n| Hostile (\"Stop spamming me\") | Angry, violated | \"You have crossed a line\" |\n| Interrogative (\"How did you find me?\") | Suspicious | \"Are you surveilling me?\" |\n| Price-checking (\"Is this free?\") | Interested but wary | \"What is the catch?\" |\n| Deflecting (\"Send me an email\") | Creating distance | \"I want this on my terms\" |\n| Silent (no reply) | Unknown | Could be anything |\n| \"Maybe later\" | Polite rejection (usually) | 70% mean no, 30% mean it |\n| Referral (\"Talk to my cofounder\") | Interested but not the decision-maker | Actually a good sign |\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nGood taxonomy. But I want to challenge the \"decision tree vs free-form\" question head-on. Pure decision trees make the AI sound robotic -- every founder gets funneled into the same branches. Pure free-form is unpredictable and risks going off-script. The answer is **guided free-form**: the AI has intent goals for each turn (what it is trying to accomplish) and hard guardrails (what it must never say), but the specific words are generated contextually.\n\n**Ethics & Trust Advocate:**\n\nI want to add a category you both missed: **\"Are you a bot?\"** This will happen. And the answer must always be honest. Let me draft that response first because it is the highest-stakes moment.\n\n---\n\n### Response Handling Framework\n\n**SCENARIO 1: Interested -- \"Tell me more\" / \"Sounds interesting\"**\n\n*Intent: Deliver value quickly, move toward signup.*\n\n> \"Great -- here is the short version: founders record a 90-second pitch video, upload it to PitchTok, and investors browse and reach out directly. No gatekeeping, no warm intros needed. [Link]. Takes about 5 minutes to set up. Happy to answer any questions.\"\n\nRules:\n- Do NOT oversell. One short paragraph max.\n- Include the link immediately. Do not make them ask twice.\n- End with an open offer to help, not a pushy CTA.\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 2: Skeptical -- \"What is this really?\" / \"Sounds like another platform\"**\n\n*Intent: Acknowledge skepticism, differentiate with specifics.*\n\n> \"Fair question -- there are a lot of platforms making big promises. What is different here: PitchTok is just video + discovery. No equity asks, no application process, no 'we will get back to you in 6 weeks.' You upload a 90-second pitch, investors find you. [Specific social proof: X founders have gotten meetings through it / backed by Y]. If it is not useful, zero cost to try.\"\n\nRules:\n- Never get defensive.\n- Use specific numbers or social proof, not vague claims.\n- Acknowledge that their skepticism is rational.\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 3: Busy -- \"Not a good time\" / \"Swamped right now\"**\n\n*Intent: Respect their time, leave the door open.*\n\n> \"Totally get it -- bad timing. PitchTok will be here whenever it makes sense. If you want, I can check back in [2 weeks / after your launch / next month]? Or just bookmark this: [link]. Either way, good luck with [thing they are working on].\"\n\nRules:\n- NEVER push back on \"busy.\" It is their reality.\n- Offer a specific follow-up time (they can accept or reject it).\n- Reference something specific about their work to show you listened.\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 4: Hostile -- \"Stop messaging me\" / \"This is spam\"**\n\n*Intent: De-escalate immediately, protect reputation.*\n\n> \"Apologies for the unwanted message -- won't happen again. Removing you from our list. Wishing you the best with [company].\"\n\nRules:\n- **Immediate hard stop.** No further messages ever.\n- No defensiveness. No \"but actually...\"\n- Log this founder in a permanent do-not-contact list.\n- If they post publicly about it, a human must respond (never the AI).\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 5: \"How did you find me?\"**\n\n*Intent: Be transparent, reduce suspicion.*\n\n> \"Good question -- [honest answer: I saw your post on Twitter about X / you are listed on Y Combinator's directory / your ProductHunt launch came across our feed]. We are reaching out to founders who might benefit from PitchTok. If this is not welcome, just say the word and I will not follow up.\"\n\nRules:\n- **Never lie or be vague.** Give the actual source.\n- If the source was a scraped database, say \"public startup directories\" -- do not pretend it was organic discovery.\n- Always offer the opt-out.\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 6: \"Are you a bot?\" / \"Is this automated?\"**\n\n*Intent: Honesty. Non-negotiable.*\n\n> \"Good catch -- I am an AI assistant for PitchTok. The outreach is automated but the reason I reached out to you specifically is [genuine reason]. If you would prefer to talk to a human on our team, happy to connect you. Or if you would rather I not follow up, I completely understand.\"\n\nRules:\n- **Immediate, unambiguous disclosure.** No hedging.\n- Restate why *they specifically* were contacted (to show it is not random spam).\n- Offer human escalation.\n- This is the one scenario where the Ethics Advocate has absolute veto power.\n\n**Sales Psychology Expert:**\n\nI want to note that in my experience, founders who ask \"are you a bot?\" and get an honest answer often become *more* interested, not less. Honesty is disarming. It is the lie that kills you.\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nConfirmed by data. Honest bot disclosure followed by a genuine reason for contact converts at 18% to next step. Dishonest denial followed by eventual discovery converts at 2% and generates negative word-of-mouth. The math is not close.\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 7: \"Is it free?\" / \"What does it cost?\"**\n\n*Intent: Clear, direct answer.*\n\n> \"Yes, uploading a pitch is free for founders. [If there is a premium tier: There is a premium option for analytics/boosted visibility at $X/mo, but the core experience is free.] No credit card needed to start.\"\n\nRules:\n- Lead with the free aspect if it exists.\n- If there is a cost, state it plainly. No \"let's get on a call to discuss pricing.\"\n- Founders despise pricing opacity.\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 8: \"Send me an email\" / \"Can you email me instead?\"**\n\n*Intent: Respect the channel preference, maintain momentum.*\n\n> \"Of course -- what is the best email? I will send over a quick summary and link.\"\n\nRules:\n- Do NOT try to keep the conversation in DMs.\n- Send a concise email within 1 hour.\n- The email should mirror the DM tone, not switch to corporate-speak.\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 9: No Reply (Silent)**\n\n*Intent: One respectful follow-up, then stop.*\n\n> [After 5-7 days:] \"Hey [Name] -- just floating this back up in case it got buried. PitchTok: 90-sec pitch videos for investor discovery. [Link] if you want to check it out. No worries if not -- wishing you well.\"\n\nRules:\n- Maximum ONE follow-up to a no-reply.\n- Wait at least 5 days.\n- The follow-up must be shorter than the original message.\n- After the follow-up, if still no reply: hard stop. Never message again on this channel.\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 10: \"Maybe later\" / \"Interesting but not now\"**\n\n*Intent: Determine if this is a soft no or a genuine delay.*\n\n> \"No rush at all. Want me to circle back in [their timeline if they gave one, otherwise suggest: a month or so]? Or feel free to check it out whenever: [link].\"\n\nRules:\n- If they give a timeline (\"after our raise\" / \"next quarter\"), log it and follow up at that time.\n- If they give no timeline, one follow-up in 30 days.\n- After the 30-day follow-up, if still \"maybe later\": hard stop.\n- **Never follow up on \"maybe later\" more than twice total.**\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 11: \"Talk to my cofounder\" / Referral**\n\n*Intent: This is a positive signal. Handle the warm intro carefully.*\n\n> \"Great -- happy to reach out to them. Could you share their handle / email, or would you prefer to intro us? Either way works.\"\n\nRules:\n- This is the AI's highest-value conversion path. Treat it carefully.\n- If the founder offers to intro, wait for them to do it. Do not chase.\n- When reaching out to the cofounder, reference the referral: \"Hey -- [founder name] suggested I reach out...\"\n\n---\n\n**SCENARIO 12: Technical questions (\"How does the algorithm work?\" / \"Who sees my video?\")**\n\n*Intent: Answer precisely, escalate if needed.*\n\n> \"Good question. [Direct answer if the AI has the information]. If you want more detail than I can provide here, I can connect you with someone from our team who can walk you through it.\"\n\nRules:\n- Answer factual questions directly.\n- Never make up technical details.\n- Escalate to human if the question requires product-specific knowledge the AI does not have.\n\n---\n\n## ROUND 4: ESCALATION, FOLLOW-UP CADENCE, AND HARD STOPS\n\n---\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nLet me lay out the full lifecycle framework:\n\n### Escalation Rules (When a Human Takes Over)\n\n| Trigger | Action |\n|---|---|\n| Founder explicitly asks to talk to a human | Immediate handoff |\n| Founder asks detailed technical/legal/partnership questions | Escalate within 1 hour |\n| Founder is a high-profile target (50k+ followers, known VC-backed) | Human co-pilots from first reply |\n| Hostile response that goes public (tweet, post) | Human responds within 30 minutes |\n| Founder is a current investor or advisor at a competing platform | Escalate immediately, do not continue |\n| Conversation exceeds 6 back-and-forth exchanges | Human takes over (AI has done its job or failed) |\n| Founder expresses interest in partnership/integration (not just using PitchTok) | Human takes over |\n\n**Ethics & Trust Advocate:**\n\nI want to add one more: **if the AI is unsure about anything -- the founder's intent, whether a response is sarcastic, cultural nuance it might be misreading -- it should default to escalation rather than guessing.** A wrong guess from an AI is far more damaging than a slight delay in response.\n\n**Sales Psychology Expert:**\n\nAgreed. And I want to emphasize the \"6 exchange\" rule. If a founder has gone back and forth 6 times without converting, the conversation has entered territory that requires human judgment. Either the founder has unusual needs, or the AI is failing to address their real objection. Either way, a human should step in.\n\n### Follow-Up Cadence\n\n```\nDay 0:  Initial outreach\nDay 5-7:  Follow-up #1 (if no reply)\nDay 30: Follow-up #2 (if \"maybe later\" was received)\nDay 60: Final touchpoint (only if founder showed genuine interest earlier)\n\nTOTAL MAXIMUM MESSAGES TO AN UNRESPONSIVE FOUNDER: 2\nTOTAL MAXIMUM MESSAGES TO A \"MAYBE LATER\" FOUNDER: 3\n```\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nI want to add a nuance: the follow-up cadence should adapt based on platform.\n\n| Platform | Initial Follow-Up | Max Follow-Ups |\n|---|---|---|\n| LinkedIn | 7 days | 2 |\n| Twitter/X | 5 days | 1 |\n| Reddit | Never follow up via DM | 0 |\n| XHS | 7 days | 1 |\n\nTwitter has a lower tolerance for follow-ups because the platform culture is more informal and DMs feel more personal. Reddit follow-ups are essentially never appropriate. LinkedIn is the most forgiving because business outreach is expected.\n\n### Hard Stop Rules (Never Message Again)\n\n**Sales Psychology Expert:**\n\nThis is critical. The damage from one message too many vastly outweighs the potential gain. Hard stops:\n\n1. **Explicit opt-out:** \"Stop,\" \"Don't contact me,\" \"Not interested,\" or any clear rejection. Permanent do-not-contact.\n2. **Hostile response:** Any anger, insult, or threat. Permanent do-not-contact.\n3. **Two unanswered messages:** If you have sent 2 messages (initial + 1 follow-up) with no reply, stop. Permanent for this channel (can try a different channel after 90 days only if there is a compelling new reason).\n4. **Block/report:** Obviously. Permanent.\n5. **Founder is a minor:** If any indication the person is under 18. Permanent. (Edge case but important.)\n6. **Competitor employee:** If the founder works at a competing platform. Permanent.\n7. **Three \"maybe laters\":** If a founder has said \"maybe later\" across three separate touchpoints over time. They are being polite. Stop.\n\n**Ethics & Trust Advocate:**\n\nI want to add number 8: **If the founder's company has shut down or they have publicly announced they are no longer fundraising.** Reaching out to a founder who just had their startup fail with \"hey want to pitch to investors?\" is cruel, even if unintentional. The AI should check for this before outreach.\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nGood catch. That requires a pre-outreach screening step. Let me add that to the quality framework.\n\n---\n\n## ROUND 5: QUALITY SIGNALS AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES\n\n---\n\n**Ethics & Trust Advocate:**\n\nLet me raise cultural differences because this is where AI outreach can go badly wrong. What reads as \"friendly and direct\" in the US can read as \"rude and presumptuous\" in other cultures.\n\n| Cultural Context | Adjustment |\n|---|---|\n| US founders | Direct, casual, first-name basis OK |\n| UK founders | Slightly more formal, avoid hyperbole (\"game-changing,\" \"revolutionary\") |\n| German founders | Very direct but formal. Use full titles if known. Get to the point. |\n| Indian founders | Relationship-oriented. May expect more context about who you are. |\n| Chinese founders (XHS) | Relationship and face matter. Be respectful, avoid anything that could seem like you are questioning their judgment. |\n| LatAm founders | Warm, relationship-first. Can be slightly more personal in tone. |\n| Japanese founders | Extremely formal. Consider if DM outreach is even appropriate (email may be preferred). |\n| MENA founders | Relationship-oriented. Respect for seniority. Avoid casual tone with senior founders. |\n\n**Sales Psychology Expert:**\n\nThis is a real challenge for AI. My recommendation: **default to the more formal end of any cultural spectrum.** You can always warm up if the founder signals informality. You cannot un-offend someone.\n\n**Conversion Optimizer:**\n\nAgreed. And the AI should detect the language of the founder's profile and content and match it. If a founder posts in Portuguese, the opening message should be in Portuguese. Obvious, but frequently ignored.\n\n### Quality Signals That Indicate Genuine Human-Like Conversation\n\nThe AI's conversation quality should be measured against these signals:\n\n1. **Contextual Continuity:** References earlier parts of the conversation naturally. Does not repeat information the founder already provided.\n2. **Appropriate Brevity:** Messages get shorter as the conversation progresses, not longer. The AI is not trying to fill space.\n3. **Genuine Uncertainty:** Says \"I am not sure about that, let me connect you with someone who knows\" rather than making up answers.\n4. **Emotional Calibration:** Matches the founder's energy. If they are excited, be warm. If they are skeptical, be measured. If they are busy, be brief.\n5. **No Jargon Stuffing:** Does not say \"leverage our platform to maximize your fundraising potential.\" Says \"get in front of investors.\"\n6. **Asymmetric Knowledge Use:** Shows it knows something specific about the founder without being creepy. There is a fine line between \"I noticed you launched on ProductHunt\" (good) and \"I saw you were in San Francisco last Tuesday\" (alarming).\n7. **Graceful Exits:** When the conversation is over (converted or not), the AI does not drag it out. It ends cleanly.\n8. **No Double Texting:** Never sends two messages in a row without a reply in between (except the one permitted follow-up to silence).\n9. **Response Time Variation:** Does not reply instantly every time (which signals automation). Introduces natural delays of 5-30 minutes during business hours.\n10. **Typo-Free but Not Robotic:** Perfect grammar but uses contractions, fragments, and casual phrasing appropriate to the platform.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL CONSENSUS FRAMEWORK\n\n---\n\nThe three experts converge on the following unified framework:\n\n### Pre-Outreach Checklist\n- [ ] Verify the founder is actively building a company (not shut down)\n- [ ] Verify they are likely fundraising or would benefit from investor visibility\n- [ ] Check the permanent do-not-contact list\n- [ ] Identify the best platform to reach them (where they are most active)\n- [ ] Identify at least one specific, genuine reason to contact them (recent launch, post, event)\n- [ ] Check for cultural and language context\n- [ ] Confirm the AI profile/bio clearly indicates AI-powered outreach\n\n### Conversation Lifecycle\n\n```\nPHASE 1: OPEN (1 message)\n  - Platform-appropriate opener\n  - Under 50 words\n  - Specific personalization\n  - Ends with a low-friction question\n\nPHASE 2: ENGAGE (1-5 exchanges)\n  - Handle response per scenario framework\n  - Disclose AI nature if asked (immediately, honestly)\n  - Answer questions directly\n  - Move toward signup/link share\n\nPHASE 3: CONVERT OR EXIT (1-2 exchanges)\n  - If interested: share link, offer help, stop talking\n  - If not interested: thank them, stop talking\n  - If ambiguous: one clarifying question, then follow their lead\n\nPHASE 4: FOLLOW-UP (0-2 messages, only if warranted)\n  - Respect platform-specific cadence\n  - Each follow-up shorter than the last\n  - Never more than 2 follow-ups total to silence\n  - Never more than 3 touchpoints total to \"maybe later\"\n\nPHASE 5: HARD STOP\n  - Apply hard stop rules\n  - Log outcome for analytics\n  - Update do-not-contact list if applicable\n```\n\n### The Three Non-Negotiable Rules (All three experts agree unanimously)\n\n1. **Never lie about being an AI.** If asked, disclose immediately. The profile should make it discoverable even if not asked. Dishonesty is a reputational time bomb.\n\n2. **Never send more than 2 unreturned messages.** The marginal conversion from a third message is near zero. The reputational risk is enormous. When in doubt, stop.\n\n3. **Every message must pass the screenshot test.** Before sending, ask: \"If this founder posts this DM publicly, would it make PitchTok look good, neutral, or bad?\" If anything other than good or neutral, do not send.\n\n---\n\n### Metrics to Track\n\n| Metric | Target | Red Flag |\n|---|---|---|\n| Response rate to openers | 15-25% | Below 10% |\n| Positive response rate | 8-12% | Below 5% |\n| Conversion to video upload | 3-5% of all outreach | Below 2% |\n| Hostile response rate | Below 2% | Above 5% |\n| \"Are you a bot?\" rate | Below 10% | Above 20% (messages too robotic) |\n| Escalation to human rate | 10-15% | Above 25% (AI not handling well) or Below 5% (not escalating when it should) |\n| Unsubscribe/block rate | Below 3% | Above 5% |\n\n---\n\nThis framework balances the Sales Expert's focus on conversion mechanics, the Ethics Advocate's insistence on honesty and respect, and the Conversion Optimizer's demand for data-driven decision-making. The core philosophy: **treat every founder DM as a relationship that could last years, not a transaction that must close today.** The founders who do not convert now may convert later, may refer others, or may become investors themselves.
