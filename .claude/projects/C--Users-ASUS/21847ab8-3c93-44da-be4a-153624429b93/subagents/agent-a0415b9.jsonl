Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, which live in a browser tab, Openclaw connects directly to your apps (Slack, Discord, WhatsApp), maintains persistent memory of every conversation, and most importantly—it executes actions.\n\n## Marketing Applications\n\nMarketing teams use OpenClaw to automate content, email campaigns, lead scoring, and social monitoring. Marketing teams save 15-20 hours per week with the biggest time savings coming from content research, first-draft generation, social media scheduling, and performance reporting automation.\n\n## Growth and Popularity\n\nOpenClaw, the open-source AI agent formerly known as Clawbot and Moltbot, just became the fastest-growing AI project in open-source history, hitting 157,000 GitHub stars in weeks. From a small open-source project to the most popular local-first AI agent platform, it has attracted over 100,000 active installations and built a community marketplace (ClawHub) with over 3,000 skills.\n\n## Key Marketing Use Cases\n\nLearn how to weaponize Openclaw AI agents for guerrilla marketing growth, automate 100+ platform launches and backlink hunting, and run 20 guerrilla marketing tactics using autonomous AI agents.\n\n## Important Security Considerations\n\nIt's worth noting that in early February 2026, security researchers disclosed a critical vulnerability with 42,000+ exposed control panels discovered across 82 countries, often with weak or default credentials.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ca91a85f-3e40-428b-81ab-5e271aa52af9","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:06.414Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"2ef5d3ea-d328-4536-aaea-9184f47c051b"}

Key features include full system access, browser control, and persistent memory. OpenClaw supports WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, and iMessage, with Microsoft Teams and Matrix support coming soon.\n\n## Pricing\n\nOpenClaw offers multiple pricing models:\n\n**Cloud Hosting:**\nOpenClaw Cloud starts from $39/month and includes everything with no API keys or setup required. OpenClaw AWS Hosting offers simple, transparent plans starting at $29/month with Base, Pro, and Agency tiers.\n\n**Self-Hosted:**\nThe software is completely free with no licensing fees, subscription costs, or built-in usage charges under the MIT license. However, hosting OpenClaw costs between $5 and $50+ per month for most deployments, and AI model usage is the highest variable cost, with most users spending between $1 and $150 per month on tokens.\n\n**API Costs:**\nOpenClaw is free to install, with real costs being AI API usage at $5-30/month for most users.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"187e0ad2-22db-491d-9343-0f25c31aba9b","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:06.642Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"7f38639e-5f4f-4e60-9bdf-3d886ef3b638"}

The AI agent finds leads, builds websites, sends emails, and calls them by phone. More specifically, it finds businesses in your niche, builds them custom sites, emails them with the preview, and follows up by phone.\n\nIt includes a dedicated server running your bot 24/7, AI model costs, the full Unloopa pipeline — lead scraping, website generation, email outreach, and AI voice calling — plus automatic updates.\n\n## Use Cases for B2B Outreach\n\nOpenClaw has also been applied by marketing agencies for lead generation. OpenClaw monitors target company news, leadership changes, funding announcements, and RFP postings using browser automation and identifies potential clients showing signals of needing marketing support — new CMO hires, product launches, expansion into new markets — and drafts personalized outreach messages.\n\n## Technical Foundation\n\nOpenClaw is a personal AI agent that runs on your machine and talks to you through the apps you already use—WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and others. It isn't another chat UI; it's a long-lived process that can read and write files, run commands, control a browser, and remember context across sessions.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2106d4ac-369f-45b4-b873-e79220c8be56","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:07.138Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"915b41c0-0371-46fe-8de8-db57f82ddc06"}

OpenClaw requires Node.js 22 or higher and can be installed via npm or pnpm.\n\nOpenClaw uses pnpm for dependency management. Additionally, TypeScript builds have been moved to tsdown + tsgo for faster builds with CI typechecks.\n\n## Architecture Components\n\nThe architecture splits into two parts: the \"Brain\" (reasoning engine handling API calls and orchestration) and the \"Hands\" (execution environment running skills like shell access and file management).\n\nThe Gateway provides a WebSocket network—a single WS control plane for clients, tools, and events. The OpenClaw gateway is written in TypeScript and is a long running process listening to the messaging channels.\n\n## Plugin System\n\nThe plugin system lives in extensions/ and follows a discovery-based model, with the plugin loader in src/plugins/loader.ts scanning workspace packages for an openclaw.extensions field in their package.json.\n\nThe Plugin SDK provides TypeScript types, validation utilities, and helper functions for plugin development and can be imported by plugins via openclaw/plugin-sdk.\n\n## Runtime Requirements\n\nArchitecture considerations primarily affect native dependencies (like sharp for image processing) and Docker sandbox images.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d99e8cd4-a95e-4e15-a7e3-e03fe4c344b6","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:17.568Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"89496791-7414-4ac1-be65-be3e88143a3a"}

What OpenClaw Does -- Core Features and Capabilities\n\nOpenClaw is a **free, open-source, autonomous AI agent** originally developed by Peter Steinberger (formerly known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot). It became the fastest-growing AI project in open-source history, hitting 157,000 GitHub stars within weeks and surpassing 100,000 active installations by early 2026.\n\nUnlike browser-based AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude), OpenClaw is a **local-first, long-lived process** that runs on your machine and connects to the apps you already use. Its core capabilities include:\n\n- **Full system access** -- reads/writes files, runs terminal commands, controls browsers\n- **Persistent memory** -- retains context across sessions and conversations\n- **Messaging-first interface** -- operates through WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, and iMessage (Microsoft Teams and Matrix coming soon)\n- **Action execution** -- it does not just advise; it autonomously executes tasks\n- **Browser automation** -- can navigate, scrape, and interact with web pages\n- **Skill extensibility** -- a plugin system with 5,705+ community-built skills on ClawHub (its public marketplace)\n\n### 2. How It Works -- Workflow, Automation, AI Agent Capabilities\n\n**Architecture:**\nOpenClaw's architecture splits into two core components:\n- **The \"Brain\"** -- the reasoning engine that handles API calls to LLMs and orchestration logic\n- **The \"Hands\"** -- the execution environment that runs skills (shell access, file management, browser control)\n\n**The Gateway** is written in TypeScript and acts as a WebSocket control plane connecting clients, tools, and events. It runs on Node.js 22+ and uses pnpm for dependency management.\n\n**Workflow execution model:**\n- **Skills** are modular plugins that add capabilities (e.g., managing GitHub repos, controlling smart home devices, automating social media)\n- **Webhooks** trigger skills on external events (new GitHub issue, Stripe payment)\n- **Scheduled tasks** enable cron-like automation without manual intervention\n- **`soul.md`** files define the agent's personality, goals, and behavioral rules\n- **`skill.md`** files define individual skill instructions and parameters\n\n**Key automation patterns for marketing/growth:**\n1. Monitor target company news, leadership changes, and funding announcements via browser automation\n2. Identify potential clients showing buying signals (new CMO hires, product launches, market expansion)\n3. Draft personalized outreach messages\n4. Execute multi-step workflows: lead scraping --> website generation --> email outreach --> AI voice calling\n\n### 3. Tech Stack\n\n| Component | Technology |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Core runtime | **Node.js 22+** |\n| Language | **TypeScript** (gateway, plugin SDK) |\n| Build tools | **tsdown + tsgo** for fast TypeScript builds |\n| Package manager | **pnpm** |\n| Plugin SDK | TypeScript types, validation utilities, helpers (importable via `openclaw/plugin-sdk`) |\n| Networking | **WebSocket** control plane |\n| AI Models | Model-agnostic -- connects to OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc. (the user pays API costs) |\n| Image processing | **sharp** (native dependency) |\n| Sandboxing | **Docker** for isolated execution |\n| Plugin discovery | File-based scanning (`src/plugins/loader.ts` reads `openclaw.extensions` from `package.json`) |\n\n### 4. Lead Generation, Outreach, and Content Creation\n\n**Lead Generation:**\n- Scrapes business directories and competitor data to find leads in specific niches\n- Monitors company news, leadership changes, funding announcements, and RFP postings\n- Identifies buying signals: new CMO hires, product launches, market expansion\n- Cross-references with Google \"People Also Ask\" data for content gap analysis\n\n**Outreach Automation:**\n- The **Unloopa integration** demonstrates a full sales pipeline: find leads --> build custom websites for them --> email previews --> follow up by AI voice call\n- Drafts personalized outreach messages based on scraped intelligence\n- Automates email campaigns with lead scoring\n\n**Content Creation:**\n- Converts a single idea into GEO-optimized blog posts, social posts, and email campaigns\n- Generates SEO-friendly content with keyword targeting\n- Manages content scheduling and planned publication\n- Automates the entire social media pipeline: ideation --> creation --> scheduling --> publishing\n- Supports multi-platform content adaptation (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook)\n- Processes media files: resizing, thumbnails, OCR text extraction\n\n**SEO Automation:**\n- Automated competitor page scraping and heading structure analysis\n- Content gap analysis cross-referenced with search intent data\n- Keyword analysis and bulk content updates\n- Marketing teams report saving **15-20 hours per week** on content research, first-draft generation, social scheduling, and performance reporting\n\n### 5. Pricing Model and Target Users\n\n**Pricing is layered:**\n\n| Model | Cost | Details |\n|-------|------|---------|\n| Self-hosted (software) | **Free** (MIT license) | No licensing, subscription, or usage fees |\n| Infrastructure (self-hosted) | **$5-50+/month** | Server hosting costs |\n| AI API usage | **$5-30/month** typical | Token costs for LLM API calls; variable based on usage |\n| OpenClaw Cloud | **From $39/month** | Managed hosting, no API keys or setup needed |\n| AWS Hosting (managed) | **From $29/month** | Base, Pro, and Agency tiers |\n\n**Target Users:**\n- **Power users and developers** -- the primary early adopters\n- **Marketing agencies** -- automating client onboarding (compressed from 3-4 hours to 15-minute automated sequences), content pipelines, and multi-channel outreach\n- **Small businesses** -- leveraging full system access for practical automation without enterprise budgets\n- **Enterprise teams** -- email triage (78% processing time reduction), reporting automation, onboarding workflows\n- **Fortune 500 / regulated industries** -- finance, healthcare, developer-heavy tech companies\n\n---\n\n## Benchmark Takeaways for Building a \"GrowthOps Agent\"\n\nIf you were to build a competing or similar product, here are the key architectural and product lessons from OpenClaw:\n\n### What to replicate:\n1. **Local-first, action-oriented architecture** -- Not a chatbot. An agent that executes. The Brain/Hands split is a clean separation of reasoning from execution.\n2. **Messaging-native interface** -- Meeting users where they already are (Slack, WhatsApp, Discord) rather than requiring a new UI.\n3. **Skill/plugin marketplace** -- ClawHub with 5,700+ skills shows the power of extensibility. A GrowthOps Agent should have modular \"playbooks\" or \"skills\" for different growth tactics.\n4. **Persistent memory** -- Critical for growth ops where context accumulates (lead history, campaign performance, content calendars).\n5. **Webhook + scheduled task triggers** -- Enabling event-driven and time-based automation without manual intervention.\n6. **Full pipeline automation** -- The Unloopa example (lead scrape --> site build --> email --> voice call) shows the value of end-to-end workflow automation rather than point solutions.\n\n### What to improve upon:\n1. **Security** -- OpenClaw has had critical vulnerabilities (42,000+ exposed control panels). A GrowthOps Agent handling business data must prioritize security from day one.\n2. **Ease of setup** -- OpenClaw still skews heavily technical. A growth-focused product should have a simpler onboarding experience.\n3. **Domain-specific intelligence** -- OpenClaw is general-purpose. A GrowthOps Agent could differentiate by embedding growth marketing knowledge directly: conversion rate optimization heuristics, channel-specific best practices, attribution modeling.\n4. **Compliance guardrails** -- CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and platform ToS compliance should be built-in, not afterthought skills.\n5. **Analytics and feedback loops** -- OpenClaw executes but has limited built-in measurement. A GrowthOps Agent should close the loop: execute --> measure --> learn --> optimize.\n\n### Suggested GrowthOps Agent architecture (informed by OpenClaw):\n- **Reasoning layer** (Brain): LLM-powered planning and decision-making with growth-specific prompts\n- **Execution layer** (Hands): Browser automation, API integrations, email sending, content publishing\n- **Memory layer**: Persistent store for leads, campaigns, content calendars, performance metrics\n- **Skill packs**: Pre-built modules for SEO, outreach, social media, content, analytics\n- **Trigger system**: Webhooks (competitor activity, lead signals) + cron (daily reports, scheduled posts)\n- **Compliance engine**: Built-in rules for email regulations, platform rate limits, data privacy\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [OpenClaw for Marketing: AI Automation Playbook 2026](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/openclaw-marketing-teams-ai-automation-playbook-2026)\n- [How To Use OpenClaw.ai For Marketing In 2026](https://marketingagent.blog/2026/01/31/how-to-use-openclaw-ai-for-marketing-in-2026-a-complete-playbook/)\n- [OpenClaw For Marketing: A Primer](https://marketingagent.blog/2026/02/12/openclaw-for-marketing-a-primer/)\n- [Unloopa for OpenClaw -- Full Sales Pipeline](https://openclaw.unloopa.com/)\n- [OpenClaw: Ultimate Guide to AI Agent Workforce 2026](https://o-mega.ai/articles/openclaw-creating-the-ai-agent-workforce-ultimate-guide-2026)\n- [OpenClaw GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)\n- [OpenClaw Official Site](https://openclaw.ai/)\n- [OpenClaw Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw)\n- [OpenClaw Architecture Explained](https://ppaolo.substack.com/p/openclaw-system-architecture-overview)\n- [OpenClaw Demystified: Installation to Architecture](https://gohsoonheng00.medium.com/openclaw-demystified-from-installation-to-architecture-29dd2580ed42)\n- [ClawHub -- Official Skill Store](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/clawhub)\n- [OpenClaw for SEO](https://openclawmarketing.com/openclaw-seo)\n- [OpenClaw Content Creation Tutorial](https://openclaw-ai.online/tutorials/use-cases/content-creation/)\n- [OpenClaw Pricing: Real Costs Explained](https://www.thecaio.ai/blog/openclaw-pricing-guide)\n- [OpenClaw Enterprise Automation Guide](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/openclaw-enterprise-automation-business-use-cases-guide)\n- [CNBC: From Clawdbot to OpenClaw](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/openclaw-open-source-ai-agent-rise-controversy-clawdbot-moltbot-moltbook.html)\n- [What the OpenClaw Moment Means for Enterprises (VentureBeat)](https://venturebeat.com/technology/what-the-openclaw-moment-means-for-enterprises-5-big-takeaways)\n- [OpenClaw for Marketing Agencies (Serif)](https://www.serif.ai/openclaw/marketing-agencies)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1913,"cache_read_input_tokens":19308,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1913,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY8xq5FLTSxHBhbUNyj8M","type":"assistant","uuid":"67fef9d0-7c80-48c0-9a2a-ff43a44683f4","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:11:32.673Z"}
