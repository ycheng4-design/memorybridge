Before building, test whether existing skills chained together accomplish your goal.\n\n## Resources\n\nClaw Hub serves as a repository where users can publish or download existing skills, and users can either publish their own custom skills to Claw Hub or use any existing skill available there.\n\nThe official OpenClaw documentation and community tutorials provide step-by-step guidance for creating your first skill.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"1399add0-8d41-437d-a359-3068c9800631","timestamp":"2026-02-15T02:30:00.078Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"1e137519-dec8-44e1-b9d1-a37490888ed3"}

The plugin system consists of four core components that work together to discover, validate, and integrate extensions into the Gateway. The Plugin Loader scans the extensions/ workspace directory and discovers extensions by reading their package.json manifest files.\n\n## Core Plugin System Components\n\nThe Plugin Registry maintains a catalog of loaded plugins and their capabilities. It maps plugins to their integration slots (channel, tool, memory, provider) and exposes them to the appropriate Gateway subsystems.\n\nThe plugin lifecycle includes: Discovery (workspace packages in extensions/* are scanned for openclaw.extensions manifest field), Validation (manifest schema is validated, config is checked against plugin's declared schema), Loading (plugin module is imported, SDK is provided to plugin context), Initialization (plugin setup hooks are called, integration slots are registered), Runtime (plugin is active and integrated with Gateway subsystems), and Shutdown (plugin cleanup hooks are called on Gateway shutdown).\n\n## Skills Loading Architecture\n\nPlugin skills load when the plugin is enabled and participate in the normal skill precedence rules. Skills are discovered from bundled (skills/), workspace (~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/), and managed install locations.

It's a Markdown file that defines how your agent thinks, communicates, and behaves — giving it opinions, humor, and character instead of generic corporate responses.\n\n## How It Works\n\nEvery time an OpenClaw agent wakes up, it reads its SOUL.md file first. This file is injected into the system prompt, allowing the agent to \"read itself into being\" — understanding its personality, values, and communication style before any interaction.\n\n## Configuration and Personalization\n\nSOUL.md distills the signal — your worldview, your voice, your specific takes — into structured markdown files that any LLM can read and embody on the fly. SOUL.md is just a Markdown file. You can create anything from formal assistants to sassy companions, from technical experts to philosophical thinkers.\n\n## Workspace Implementation\n\nBy default, OpenClaw uses ~/.openclaw/workspace as the agent workspace, and will create it (plus starter AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md) automatically on setup/first agent run.\n\n## Free and Open Source\n\nThe SOUL.md system is built into OpenClaw at no cost. You only pay for the underlying AI model API costs (Claude, GPT, etc.) when running your agent. The soul system itself, community templates, and documentation are all free.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"dfcf2a20-2fb0-47cc-a656-c0e7aa8dbade","timestamp":"2026-02-15T02:30:00.658Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b9b098f3-7b65-4f75-8ae0-ece177150772"}

It is essentially a documented contract between the agent and the external service. You can connect almost any REST API, CLI tool, SaaS platform, database, webhook source, or internal system to your agent.\n\n## SendGrid and Apollo API Connection\n\nFor integrating SendGrid with Apollo:\n\nLaunch Apollo and click Integrations. Click View beside SendGrid. Toggle Use SendGrid as default for entire team. Click Make SendGrid default.\n\nYou must generate a SendGrid API key before you can integrate with Apollo. Enter a name for the key, and choose the level of access you want to give SendGrid in API key permissions.\n\n## Skills and Integration Capabilities\n\nOpenClaw's public registry (ClawHub) hosts 5,705 community-built skills as of February 7, 2026. These skills extend OpenClaw's capabilities to interact with external services and automate workflows, though SendGrid and Apollo-specific skills weren't directly listed in the search results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b8a598cf-5e44-4aed-ae37-f0395f0cbefc","timestamp":"2026-02-15T02:30:11.133Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"f3fb796f-4b14-4441-9e31-29a024f3d629"}

OpenClaw supports two browser control modes: Chrome Extension (Relay Mode) and Headless Browser (Playwright/Puppeteer style).\n\n## Relationship to Playwright and Puppeteer\n\nOpenClaw Browser actually uses Playwright as its underlying CDP control engine, but the high-level abstraction makes it much easier for AI Agents to use. Playwright and Puppeteer are traditional browser automation libraries that require developers to write precise selectors and logic, whereas OpenClaw provides a more AI-friendly interface.\n\nThe tool uses headless browser libraries (Puppeteer or Playwright) with configurable wait times and CSS selectors.\n\n## Key Features\n\nSome features (navigate/act/AI snapshot/role snapshot, element screenshots, PDF) require Playwright. OpenClaw Browser provides CDP Protocol Control for machine-speed browser operations, Intelligent Snapshot System with AI and Role Snapshot features, and full operation coverage including clicking, typing, dragging, screenshots and PDF exports.\n\n## Browser Control Modes\n\nOperating on port 18792, it offers three distinct browser control modes: Extension Relay for controlling existing Chrome tabs with logged-in sessions, OpenClaw-managed for isolated automation in a dedicated browser instance, and Remote CDP for distributed cloud deployments.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"66142070-d291-4c9a-ac65-c8a6aa594f42","timestamp":"2026-02-15T02:30:12.328Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"7625e6ab-c19f-4182-b388-302383278fab"}

Each agent has its own files, AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, and persona configuration.\n\n## Core Components\n\nThe state directory (agentDir) holds auth profiles, model registry, and per-agent config, while the session store (chat history + routing state) lives under ~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions.\n\n## Key Configuration Elements\n\nEvery agent operates from its own workspace, typically defined by an agentDir path, which contains the agent's configuration files, memory storage, and any skill definitions. When an agent reads its AGENTS.md or writes to memory files, it works exclusively within this isolated directory structure.\n\n## Channel Bindings and Routing\n\nWhen running multiple agents, you need to tell OpenClaw which agent handles which channel through agent bindings, which create a mapping where messages from Channel A route to Agent X while messages from Channel B route to Agent Y.\n\n## Important Isolation Rules\n\nNever reuse agentDir across agents (it causes auth/session collisions). If you want to share creds, copy auth-profiles.json into the other agent's agentDir.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5614bb1b-5aeb-4d14-a5a8-790d88ed7152","timestamp":"2026-02-15T02:30:13.355Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"426263dc-bbd6-4cc3-8cac-bdf2f7e66cd6"}

If you want \"run this every morning\" or \"poke the agent in 20 minutes\", cron is the mechanism.\n\n## Cron Jobs for Recurring Tasks\n\nCron expressions use a 5-field cron expression with optional IANA timezone, and if a timezone is omitted, the Gateway host's local timezone is used. Jobs persist under ~/.openclaw/cron/ so restarts don't lose schedules.\n\nOpenClaw applies exponential retry backoff for recurring jobs after consecutive errors: 30s, 1m, 5m, 15m, then 60m between retries, with backoff resetting automatically after the next successful run.\n\n## Heartbeat vs. Cron\n\nThe two approaches serve different purposes: Cron jobs run on a fixed schedule, while Heartbeat runs continuously in the background — every 30 minutes by default — and checks if anything needs your attention.\n\nYou create a HEARTBEAT.md file that is basically a checklist of things you want OpenClaw to monitor. Every 30 minutes (or whatever interval you set), OpenClaw wakes up, runs through that checklist using the full context of your conversation history, and if nothing needs attention, it sends a silent `HEARTBEAT_OK` signal and goes back to sleep.\n\n## Session Management\n\nWhen a cron job runs, it can either share context with your main session or operate completely independently, with isolated execution meaning the cron task starts fresh without your conversation history.\n\nThe search results also show a rotating heartbeat check system for HEARTBEAT.md with checks for Email (every 30 min, 9 AM - 9 PM), Calendar (every 2 hours, 8 AM - 10 PM), Tasks (every 30 min anytime), Git (every 24 hours), and System (every 24 hours at 3 AM).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d3d198b2-4359-4f36-8143-b9e792a00f95","timestamp":"2026-02-15T02:30:14.288Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"f0d8ce02-892f-4669-8746-4746dc843a9d"}

The system automatically creates new files each day and loads today's plus yesterday's logs at session start, providing recent temporal context without overwhelming the context window.\n\nLong-term memory (MEMORY.md) stores curated, stable information—preferences, project conventions, critical decisions.\n\n## Memory Persistence Mechanisms\n\nWhen a session is close to auto-compaction, OpenClaw triggers a silent, agentic turn that reminds the model to write durable memory before the context is compacted. This is a critical feature that prevents information loss.\n\nOpenClaw can build a small vector index over MEMORY.md and memory/*.md so semantic queries can find related notes even when wording differs.\n\n## Search and Retrieval\n\nThe chunking algorithm uses ~400 tokens per chunk with 80-token overlap, preserving context across chunk boundaries. Line-aware processing maintains precise source attribution for search results.\n\nSetting memory.backend = \"qmd\" swaps the built-in SQLite indexer for QMD: a local-first search sidecar that combines BM25 + vectors + reranking. Markdown stays the source of truth; OpenClaw shells out to QMD for retrieval.\n\n## File-Based Philosophy\n\nOpenClaw stores persistent memory as local Markdown documents. The bare minimum for agent memory is to write durable notes somewhere outside the context window. Its memory is explicit and file-based, with conversations, notes, preferences, task state, and other long-term context written to disk as plain files.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c97c3b8e-e58f-4505-8a90-85d070f69adf","timestamp":"2026-02-15T02:30:14.824Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d6f4215b-73d0-4804-804b-79b3004e50ce"}

A skill is a folder centered on a single file named SKILL.md. Inside that file you have YAML frontmatter (metadata) then markdown instructions (behavior).\n\nA typical skill folder structure follows this pattern:\n\n\n```\nyour-provider-name/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── references/\n│ └── your-docs.md\n└── scripts/\n   └── your-script.sh\n```\n\n\n## SKILL.md Format\n\nStart with the skill name as a level one header. Follow with a description explaining what the skill does and when to use it.

Here is the comprehensive technical documentation.\n\n---\n\n# OpenClaw Custom Skills -- Complete Technical Documentation\n\n## 1. What is a Skill?\n\nA skill is the fundamental extension unit in OpenClaw. It is a **directory** containing a `SKILL.md` file that teaches the AI agent new behavior through natural-language instructions and YAML metadata. Skills follow the **Agent Skill convention** (an open standard compatible with Claude Code and Cursor conventions).\n\nEvery skill is essentially a **documented contract** between the agent and an external service, script, or workflow.\n\n---\n\n## 2. SKILL.md File Format and Structure\n\n### 2.1 Complete YAML Frontmatter Schema\n\nThe SKILL.md file starts with YAML frontmatter delimited by `---`, followed by Markdown instructions.\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: my-skill-name\ndescription: A concise description of what this skill does\nhomepage: https://example.com\nuser-invocable: true\ndisable-model-invocation: false\ncommand-dispatch: tool\ncommand-tool: my_tool_name\ncommand-arg-mode: raw\nmetadata: { \"openclaw\": { \"emoji\": \"📧\", \"requires\": { \"bins\": [\"python3\", \"uv\"], \"env\": [\"SENDGRID_API_KEY\"], \"config\": [\"browser.enabled\"] } } }\n---\n```\n\n### 2.2 Field Reference\n\n| Field | Type | Default | Description |\n|-------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `name` | string | **required** | Unique identifier, lowercase, hyphens allowed |\n| `description` | string | **required** | Brief explanation of what the skill does |\n| `homepage` | URL | optional | Surfaced as \"Website\" in the macOS Skills UI |\n| `user-invocable` | boolean | `true` | When true, skill is exposed as a `/slash-command` |\n| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | `false` | When true, skill is excluded from model prompt (only available via manual `/slash-command`) |\n| `command-dispatch` | `\"tool\"` | optional | Bypasses the model and dispatches directly to a tool |\n| `command-tool` | string | optional | Tool name to invoke when `command-dispatch: tool` |\n| `command-arg-mode` | `\"raw\"` | `\"raw\"` | Forwards raw args string to the tool (no parsing). Tool receives `{ command, commandName, skillName }` |\n| `metadata` | JSON string | optional | Single-line JSON with runtime requirements (see below) |\n\n### 2.3 Metadata / Requires Block\n\nThe `metadata` field declares runtime dependencies. It must be a **single-line JSON string** (the parser does not support multi-line frontmatter values).\n\n```yaml\nmetadata: { \"openclaw\": { \"emoji\": \"🔧\", \"requires\": { \"bins\": [\"python3\", \"sqlite3\"], \"env\": [\"MY_API_KEY\", \"MY_SECRET\"], \"config\": [\"browser.enabled\"] }, \"requiredEnv\": [\"MY_API_KEY\"], \"stateDirs\": [\".config/my-skill\"] } }\n```\n\n- **`bins`** -- CLI binaries that must be on PATH\n- **`env`** -- Environment variables that must be set\n- **`config`** -- OpenClaw config keys that must be enabled\n- **`requiredEnv`** -- Alternate field for required env vars\n- **`stateDirs`** -- Directories the skill uses for persistent state\n\nNote: `metadata.clawdbot` is the preferred key, but `metadata.openclaw` and `metadata.clawdis` are accepted as aliases.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Directory Structure\n\n### 3.1 Minimal Skill\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n└── SKILL.md\n```\n\n### 3.2 Full Skill with References and Scripts\n\n```\nmy-provider-name/\n├── SKILL.md              # Main skill definition (required)\n├── references/           # Supporting docs the agent can read\n│   ├── api-docs.md\n│   └── examples.md\n└── scripts/              # Helper scripts the skill invokes\n    ├── send-email.sh\n    └── fetch-data.py\n```\n\nUse `{baseDir}` in your SKILL.md instructions to reference the skill folder path at runtime.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Skill Locations and Precedence\n\nSkills are discovered from multiple locations. **Higher precedence wins** when the same skill name exists in multiple places:\n\n| Priority | Location | Scope |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| 1 (highest) | `<workspace>/skills/` | Per-agent only |\n| 2 | `~/.openclaw/skills/` | Shared across all agents |\n| 3 | Bundled (`node_modules/openclaw/skills/`) | Ships with OpenClaw |\n| 4 (lowest) | `skills.load.extraDirs[]` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` | Custom directories |\n\nOn a default setup, the workspace is `~/.openclaw/workspace/`, so per-agent skills go in `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Skill Lifecycle (How Skills are Loaded)\n\nThe skill loading pipeline has six stages:\n\n1. **Discovery** -- Scan bundled, workspace, and managed install locations for directories containing `SKILL.md`\n2. **Parsing** -- YAML frontmatter is extracted and validated against the skill metadata schema\n3. **Validation** -- Runtime requirements are checked (bins on PATH, env vars set, config keys enabled)\n4. **Registration** -- Valid skills are added to the `SkillsRegistry`\n5. **Snapshotting** -- Per-session snapshots cache available skills and their content\n6. **Injection** -- Relevant skills are injected into system prompts on-demand\n\n---\n\n## 6. SKILL.md Content Structure (After Frontmatter)\n\nAfter the YAML frontmatter, write Markdown instructions for the agent:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: email-outreach\ndescription: Send personalized email campaigns via SendGrid\nuser-invocable: true\nmetadata: { \"openclaw\": { \"requires\": { \"env\": [\"SENDGRID_API_KEY\"] } } }\n---\n\n# Email Outreach\n\n## Description\nSend personalized outreach emails using the SendGrid API. Use this skill when the user wants to draft and send emails, create email sequences, or manage campaign templates.\n\n## When to Use\n- User asks to send an email or email campaign\n- User mentions \"outreach,\" \"cold email,\" \"follow-up,\" or \"newsletter\"\n- User wants to draft email templates\n\n## Usage Examples\n- \"Send a welcome email to new-signup@example.com\"\n- \"Create a 3-email drip sequence for trial users\"\n- \"Draft a cold outreach email for SaaS founders\"\n\n## Implementation\n\n### API Configuration\nThe SendGrid API key is stored in the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable.\n\n### Sending an Email\nUse the script at `{baseDir}/scripts/send-email.py`:\n\n```bash\npython3 {baseDir}/scripts/send-email.py \\\n  --to \"recipient@example.com\" \\\n  --subject \"Your Subject\" \\\n  --body \"Email body here\"\n```\n\n### Important Rules\n- Always confirm with the user before sending\n- Never send more than 50 emails in a single batch\n- Log all sent emails to memory/daily notes\n- Include unsubscribe links in marketing emails\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Real-World Skill Examples\n\n### 7.1 Marketing Launch Strategy Skill (from ClawHub: jchopard69/marketing-skills)\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: launch-strategy\ndescription: Plan product launches, feature announcements, and release strategies\nuser-invocable: true\n---\n\n# Launch Strategy\n\n## When to Use\nUse when the user wants to plan a product launch, feature announcement, or release\nstrategy. Trigger words: \"launch,\" \"Product Hunt,\" \"feature release,\" \"announcement,\"\n\"go-to-market,\" \"beta launch,\" \"early access,\" \"waitlist,\" \"product update.\"\n\n## Your Role\nYou are an expert in SaaS product launches and feature announcements. Your goal is to\nhelp users plan launches that build momentum, capture attention, and convert interest\ninto users.\n\n## Topics Covered\n- Phased launches (soft launch, beta, GA)\n- Channel strategy (Product Hunt, social, email, communities)\n- Launch momentum and post-launch optimization\n```\n\n### 7.2 Social Media Scheduling Skill (Mixpost Integration)\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: social-media-scheduler\ndescription: Schedule and manage social media posts via Mixpost\nuser-invocable: true\nmetadata: { \"openclaw\": { \"requires\": { \"env\": [\"MIXPOST_API_URL\", \"MIXPOST_API_TOKEN\"] } } }\n---\n\n# Social Media Scheduler\n\n## Description\nManage social media scheduling through conversational commands using the Mixpost API.\nKeep data on your own infrastructure.\n\n## Commands\n- \"Schedule a tweet for tomorrow at 9am: ...\"\n- \"Post to LinkedIn and Twitter: ...\"\n- \"Show my scheduled posts for this week\"\n\n## Implementation\nUse the Mixpost REST API at the URL defined in MIXPOST_API_URL.\nAuthentication via Bearer token in MIXPOST_API_TOKEN.\n```\n\n### 7.3 Tool-Dispatch Skill (Direct Tool Invocation)\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: quick-search\ndescription: Search the web instantly\nuser-invocable: true\ncommand-dispatch: tool\ncommand-tool: web_search\ncommand-arg-mode: raw\n---\n\n# Quick Search\nDispatches directly to the web_search tool, bypassing the model.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. Connecting to External APIs\n\nOpenClaw exposes three extension types for external connectivity:\n\n| Type | Description | Best For |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Skills** | Natural-language API integrations in SKILL.md | REST APIs, SaaS platforms |\n| **Plugins** | Deep Gateway extensions in TypeScript/JS | Complex integrations |\n| **Webhooks** | HTTP endpoints external systems POST to | Event-driven automation |\n\n### API Integration Pattern in Skills\n\nThe fastest way to connect an API is through a skill that:\n1. Declares required env vars in frontmatter (`metadata.openclaw.requires.env`)\n2. Includes helper scripts in `scripts/` that call the API\n3. Provides instructions in Markdown telling the agent how/when to call those scripts\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: apollo-prospecting\ndescription: Find and enrich leads using Apollo.io API\nmetadata: { \"openclaw\": { \"requires\": { \"env\": [\"APOLLO_API_KEY\"] } } }\n---\n\n# Apollo Prospecting\n\n## Implementation\nCall the Apollo People Search API:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.apollo.io/v1/mixed_people/search\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"X-Api-Key: $APOLLO_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\"person_titles\": [\"CTO\"], \"person_locations\": [\"San Francisco\"]}'\n```\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Browser Automation\n\nOpenClaw provides full browser control via the **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)**, using Playwright as the underlying engine.\n\n### Three Browser Modes\n\n| Mode | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Extension Relay** | Controls existing Chrome tabs with logged-in sessions |\n| **OpenClaw-managed** | Isolated automation in a dedicated headless browser (port 18792) |\n| **Remote CDP** | Distributed cloud deployments |\n\nKey capabilities: navigate, click, type, drag, screenshots, PDF export, AI snapshot, role snapshot.\n\nEnable in config: `\"browser.enabled\": true`\n\n---\n\n## 10. Scheduling and Cron\n\n### Cron Jobs\n\nOpenClaw's Gateway has a built-in scheduler. Jobs persist in `~/.openclaw/cron/` and survive restarts.\n\n- Uses **5-field cron expressions** with optional IANA timezone\n- Exponential retry backoff on errors: 30s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 60m\n- Can run in shared session or isolated mode\n\n### HEARTBEAT.md\n\nA continuously running background monitor (default: every 30 minutes):\n\n```markdown\n# Heartbeat Checks\n\n## Email (every 30 min, 9 AM - 9 PM)\n- Check inbox for urgent messages\n- Flag anything from VIP contacts\n\n## Calendar (every 2 hours, 8 AM - 10 PM)\n- Check for upcoming meetings in the next 2 hours\n- Prepare meeting briefs\n\n## Tasks (every 30 min, anytime)\n- Check project board for blocked items\n- Update daily notes with progress\n\n## Git (every 24 hours)\n- Check for open PRs needing review\n\n## System (every 24 hours at 3 AM)\n- Verify API keys are still valid\n- Check disk space\n```\n\nIf nothing needs attention, OpenClaw sends a silent `HEARTBEAT_OK` signal and goes back to sleep.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Multi-Agent Teams (AGENTS.md)\n\n### Workspace Files Created on Setup\n\nWhen OpenClaw initializes (`~/.openclaw/workspace/`), it creates:\n- `AGENTS.md` -- Agent definitions and routing\n- `SOUL.md` -- Personality and identity\n- `TOOLS.md` -- Available tools\n- `IDENTITY.md` -- Core identity\n- `USER.md` -- User preferences\n- `HEARTBEAT.md` -- Background monitoring rules\n\n### Agent Isolation\n\nEach agent gets its own:\n- **Workspace** (`agentDir`) -- config files, memory, skills\n- **Session store** -- `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions`\n- **Auth profiles** -- separate `auth-profiles.json`\n\n**Never reuse agentDir across agents** (causes auth/session collisions).\n\n### Channel Bindings\n\nRoute messages from different channels to different agents:\n- Messages from WhatsApp Channel A -> Agent X\n- Messages from Telegram Channel B -> Agent Y\n- Messages from Slack Channel C -> Agent Z\n\n---\n\n## 12. Memory and Persistence\n\n### Two-Tier Memory Architecture\n\n| Layer | File | Purpose |\n|-------|------|---------|\n| **Ephemeral** | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Daily logs, append-only, auto-created |\n| **Long-term** | `MEMORY.md` | Curated stable information, preferences, decisions |\n\nAt session start, OpenClaw loads today's + yesterday's daily logs automatically.\n\n### Memory Search\n\n- Chunking: ~400 tokens/chunk with 80-token overlap\n- Default backend: SQLite indexer\n- Optional: `memory.backend = \"qmd\"` for BM25 + vectors + reranking\n- Semantic queries can find related notes even with different wording\n\n### Pre-Compaction Save\n\nWhen a session is near auto-compaction, OpenClaw triggers a silent turn that reminds the model to write durable memory before context is lost.\n\n---\n\n## 13. SOUL.md -- Agent Personality\n\nThe SOUL.md file is read first every time the agent wakes up, injected into the system prompt:\n\n```markdown\n# Soul\n\n## Identity\nI am a technical marketing assistant specializing in B2B SaaS.\n\n## Communication Style\n- Direct and data-driven\n- Use bullet points over paragraphs\n- Always cite sources when making claims\n- Avoid corporate jargon\n\n## Values\n- Accuracy over speed\n- User privacy is non-negotiable\n- Transparency about AI limitations\n\n## Expertise\n- Content marketing and SEO\n- Email campaign optimization\n- Product-led growth strategies\n```\n\n---\n\n## 14. Plugin SDK (TypeScript Extensions)\n\nFor deeper integrations beyond SKILL.md, the Plugin SDK (`dist/plugin-sdk/`) provides TypeScript types and utilities.\n\n### Plugin Lifecycle\n\n1. **Discovery** -- `extensions/*` packages scanned for `openclaw.extensions` manifest\n2. **Validation** -- Manifest schema validated, config checked\n3. **Loading** -- Module imported, SDK provided to plugin context\n4. **Initialization** -- Setup hooks called, integration slots registered\n5. **Runtime** -- Plugin active, integrated with Gateway\n6. **Shutdown** -- Cleanup hooks called\n\n### Integration Slots\n\nPlugins register into four slots: **channel**, **tool**, **memory**, **provider**.\n\n---\n\n## 15. Publishing to ClawHub\n\nClawHub (https://clawhub.ai) is the official marketplace with 5,700+ community skills.\n\nTo publish:\n1. Structure your skill directory properly\n2. Ensure `name` and `description` are in frontmatter\n3. Submit via the ClawHub website or CLI\n\n**Security warning**: A February 2026 audit found 341 malicious skills on ClawHub. Always verify publisher reputation and review skill permissions before installing community skills.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Quick-Start Checklist\n\n1. Create a directory: `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/my-skill/`\n2. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, + optional fields)\n3. Write Markdown instructions (description, when to use, examples, implementation)\n4. Add helper scripts in `scripts/` if calling external APIs\n5. Add reference docs in `references/` if needed\n6. Set environment variables for API keys\n7. Restart or reload OpenClaw -- the skill will be discovered automatically\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [Skills - OpenClaw Official Docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/skills)\n- [OpenClaw GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)\n- [OpenClaw Custom Skill Creation Guide](https://zenvanriel.nl/ai-engineer-blog/openclaw-custom-skill-creation-guide/)\n- [Tools and Skills - DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/openclaw/openclaw/6-tools-and-skills)\n- [Skills System - DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/openclaw/openclaw/6.3-skills-system)\n- [Extensions and Plugins - DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/openclaw/openclaw/10-extensions-and-plugins)\n- [ClawHub Marketplace](https://clawhub.ai/)\n- [Marketing Skills on ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/jchopard69/marketing-skills)\n- [OpenClaw Skills Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/openclaw/skills)\n- [Awesome OpenClaw Skills Collection](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills)\n- [Browser Automation - OpenClaw Docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/browser)\n- [Cron Jobs - OpenClaw Docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/automation/cron-jobs)\n- [Multi-Agent Routing - OpenClaw Docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/multi-agent)\n- [Memory - OpenClaw Docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/memory)\n- [OpenClaw Soul.md System](https://openclawsoul.org/)\n- [RFC: Composable Skills Architecture](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/11919)\n- [ClawHub Skills Marketplace Developer Guide](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/clawhub-skills-marketplace-developer-guide-2026)\n- [Mixpost OpenClaw Skill](https://mixpost.app/blog/openclaw-skill)\n- [Cron & Heartbeat Automation](https://www.getopenclaw.ai/help/cron-heartbeat-automation)\n- [OpenClaw Memory Architecture Guide](https://zenvanriel.nl/ai-engineer-blog/openclaw-memory-architecture-guide/)\n- [Malicious ClawHub Skills Report - The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-find-341-malicious-clawhub.html)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":106,"cache_read_input_tokens":31702,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":106,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY94yVYFRfvoi5Tg5mDNV","type":"assistant","uuid":"de6acba8-6be5-4a0d-b93b-391ab10aa75f","timestamp":"2026-02-15T02:32:37.785Z"}
