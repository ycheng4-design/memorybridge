Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Platform Overview & Growth\n\nXiaohongshu was founded in 2013 as a shopping guide platform and found product-market fit as a lifestyle and content sharing platform for young urban Chinese women, particularly Millennials and Gen Z users. Following the TikTok ban in January 2025, Xiaohongshu has emerged as one of the most popular social platforms globally, with a large number of overseas users migrating to it, accelerating the platform's international expansion.\n\n## Financial Performance & Valuation\n\nXiaohongshu hit $4.8B in revenue in 2024, up 30% year-over-year, and as of September 2025, the company projects full-year profit to triple to $3 billion. In September 2025, Xiaohongshu's valuation reached $31 billion in recent secondary transactions, up from $20 billion in January 2025.\n\n## Content Strategy & Marketing Trends for 2025\n\nIn June 2025, the platform rolled out a significant algorithm upgrade, where content visibility is now determined by a weighted contribution model that rewards platform consistency and community engagement. Posts must be at least 60% original to be considered for broader promotion.\n\nThe platform's unique content ecosystem includes user-generated content (UGC), key opinion leaders (KOLs), and key opinion consumers (KOCs), allowing brands to connect with consumers more authentically and engagingly.\n\n## Recruitment & Platform Features\n\nThe search results reference Xiaohongshu's job portal (job.xiaohongshu.com), though specific recruitment details for 2025-2026 were not detailed in these results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"231ea24c-830b-4177-a2e2-a7f23842800c","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:14.765Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"252df502-8494-41b1-91db-950cb99743e4"}

In 2026, cloud-based tools with conservative activity models are statistically safer than browser extensions.\n\n## Safety Best Practices in 2026\n\nLinkedIn bans patterns, not tools. Automation that mimics focused human work survives, while automation that mimics bulk processing does not. Using LinkedIn automation tools is safe in 2026 as long as you follow responsible practices.\n\n## Popular AI-Powered Tools\n\nSeveral prominent options include:\n\n- **Cognism**: A sales intelligence platform with powerful AI and LinkedIn tools designed to supercharge prospect research and sales outreach, powered by Cortex AI.\n\n- **Outreachly**: An AI-powered LinkedIn and email assistant that writes campaign content, suggests smart replies, auto-comments on posts, and manages your inbox – helping boost leads by over 70%.\n\n- **Closely**: Runs LinkedIn automation that mimics real behavior — smart limits, delays, and human-like timing — so your account stays safe while reply rates go up.\n\n- **Konnector.AI**: Uses a hybrid execution model, combining controlled browser-based actions with cloud-orchestrated logic, allowing actions to run in a real LinkedIn session when required, while decision-making, pacing, and sequencing are managed centrally.\n\n## Important Compliance Considerations\n\nEstablishing clear protocols for data collection, storage, and usage ensures compliance with privacy regulations and maintains data integrity. Using LinkedIn automation tools is safe in 2026 as long as you follow responsible practices.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a8cab160-34c5-4dc3-b664-647e4c6a09ea","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:14.831Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0f8a33fe-9075-4295-a9d8-65fda80504da"}

While the standard limit is 100 per week for most accounts, trusted users with a high Social Selling Index (SSI) and premium accounts (like Sales Navigator) can often reach up to 200 per week.\n\nLinkedIn will reduce your connection limit if you have low acceptance rates or if other users are reporting you with the \"I don't know this person\" button. If your acceptance rate drops below 30%, the algorithm assumes your outreach is spam and will tighten your restrictions.\n\n## Message Limits\n\nThere is no set daily limit for how many messages you can send on LinkedIn, but we recommend keeping new outreach to 100 messages per week on free accounts and 150 per week on paid accounts. You can send up to 150 messages per day to your existing connections, and you get 10 message requests per week to non-connections.\n\nSafe limit: No more than 100–150 unsolicited messages per week.\n\n## Profile Viewing Limits\n\nFree LinkedIn members can view up to 500 profiles per day, while users with premium subscriptions like Sales Navigator or Recruiter can view up to 2,000 profiles per day.\n\n## Consequences of Violations\n\nExceeding these thresholds can lead to a \"LinkedIn Jail\" restriction, lasting from 24 hours to several days.\n\n## Key Compliance Practices\n\nLinkedIn's message filters are always watching for patterns: identical copy, aggressive timing, generic follow-ups, and velocity. To stay compliant, focus on personalization and avoid automation that mimics bot behavior.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"9ee7ee0f-fe0c-4387-822f-fdf626594f50","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:15.429Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"4ca620bc-29e1-4fa1-bca1-064da3455b3d"}

Users can generate blog posts, social media copy, and email subject lines, or even build entire campaigns with AI assistance. HubSpot added Breeze AI in 2025—basically embedding an AI marketing assistant directly into the platform for CRM + email + automation + AI copilot.\n\nTop tools include Bit Flows for workflow automation, ActiveCampaign for email marketing, HubSpot for CRM, Jasper AI for content, and Hootsuite for social media automation.\n\n### Email Marketing & Multi-Channel Tools\n\nOmnisend stands out for eCommerce email and multi-channel campaigns, making email, SMS, and push campaigns simple, personalized, and easy to manage for small to mid-sized stores.\n\n### Workflow Automation & LLM Integration\n\nGumloop is the most underrated AI tool on the market right now, founded just a year ago by two Canadian prodigies. Gumloop lets you connect any LLM model (like GPT-4, Claude, Grok, etc.) to your internal tools and workflows — without writing a single line of code.\n\n### Content Generation & AI Copywriting\n\nThe AI Content Assistant helps write blog posts, emails, and social media updates, which makes creating campaigns much faster. Narrato excels as best for AI-powered content workflows.\n\n### Advanced Campaign Optimization\n\nPixis is best for AI media buying and campaign optimization, connecting to both Meta and Google Ads accounts to reallocate budget across ad sets, automatically test creatives, and refine audience targeting based on live performance data.\n\n### B2B Platforms\n\nSalesforce's B2B marketing automation tool, which used to be called Pardot, is built for businesses that already use the Salesforce CRM, with Einstein AI featuring Behavior Scoring to spot which prospects are ready to talk to sales.\n\nThese tools offer various capabilities in email automation, A/B testing, LLM content generation, and workflow automation tailored to different business sizes and needs.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"116dd257-7167-4e62-a599-cdd481853d6b","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:16.401Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"80cd0a08-c984-4b2a-aaf2-4e6851e8f875"}

Avoid using +all as it allows any server to send emails on your behalf—use -all for strict enforcement, or start with ~all (soft fail) during testing phases.\n\n**DKIM Configuration:**\n\nUse strong keys (2048-bit), rotate them periodically, and align with your domain.\n\n**DMARC Deployment:**\n\nStart with a monitoring policy (p=none), analyze reports, and gradually enforce stricter rules (quarantine → reject).\n\n## Impact on Deliverability\n\nAuthenticated senders are up to 2.7x more likely to reach the inbox, which directly impacts meetings booked and pipeline created.\n\nInbox providers now expect unsubscribe actions to be fast and frictionless, especially for promotional email, and ignoring unsubscribe expectations increases complaints which damage reputation fast.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ec76a69c-c4bc-4037-8ff2-617d9c73fe77","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:16.426Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"e1a70f49-1cce-45cf-a225-d9d2283124e1"}

[2026]\",\"url\":\"https://moosend.com/blog/postmark-vs-sendgrid/\"}]\n\nBased on the web search results, here's a comprehensive comparison of SendGrid, Postmark, and Amazon SES regarding email A/B testing capabilities and API integration for 2025-2026:\n\n## A/B Testing Capabilities\n\nSendGrid provides the most comprehensive email platform with marketing automation, A/B testing, and advanced segmentation, making it suitable for both transactional and marketing emails. This positions SendGrid as the clear leader for A/B testing functionality among the three platforms.\n\nAmazon SES, in contrast, lacks these marketing features. SES doesn't let you track and monitor message events, so crucial functionality like suppressing delivery to bounces and spam complaints isn't available out-of-the-box. You'd have to build these features yourself—and that takes time and effort.\n\nPostmark does not appear to emphasize A/B testing as a core feature, focusing instead on transactional email reliability.\n\n## API Integration\n\nSendGrid offers developer-friendly APIs with extensive documentation and SDKs in multiple languages (Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, etc.). Includes prebuilt endpoints for sending, tracking, and analytics, making it easier to integrate quickly.\n\nFor Amazon SES, Amazon SES provides a powerful and flexible API, but requires more technical setup. You need to work with AWS SDKs or the SMTP interface to configure sending, tracking, and authentication fully.\n\nPostmark also supports solid API integration, with Postmark known for fast delivery, high reliability, and simple onboarding. It's one of the strongest AWS SES alternatives for teams that value transparency and speed over massive volume discounts.\n\n## Overall Comparison Summary\n\nPostmark is ideal if you send notifications, password resets, receipt emails, and want very high deliverability without marketing-bulk overhead. SendGrid offers breadth of features and is good if you'll scale into marketing workflows beyond pure transactional email.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0e62b021-a0b6-4f9d-8ff9-a2da6f0e7476","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:28.279Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"04043a6c-439d-4a54-9729-6914d8b82e86"}

Many enterprise stacks use a hybrid approach: Webhooks/events for triggering, APIs for enrichment, validation, and reconciliation.\n\nTo meet integration requirements, balance real-time and batch synchronization. Use webhooks for real-time updates on critical events, while relying on batch sync for larger operations to optimize efficiency.\n\n## Webhook Best Practices\n\nWhen evaluating CRM integration methods, check (1) webhook retry behaviour, (2) event history/replay support, (3) payload completeness, and (4) API rate limits, then design for gaps with a hybrid model.\n\nIf your CRM supports webhooks or event subscriptions, use them to enable near real-time updates rather than relying on constant polling. Design event handlers to be idempotent by verifying unique identifiers, such as a combination of contact_id and event_id, to prevent duplicate processing.\n\n## Marketing Automation Integration\n\nThe technical foundation of integration typically relies on APIs, webhooks, and middleware to facilitate seamless communication among platforms. So, rather than exporting and importing CSV files or manually updating records, integrated systems synchronize customer interactions, campaign responses, and purchase activity in real time.\n\nBest practices include personalizing campaigns with CRM data, setting up accurate lead scoring, maintaining visibility into post-SQL activities, eliminating duplicate records, and staying agile with ongoing adjustments.\n\n## Error Handling & Reliability\n\nWhen dealing with transient errors or rate limits (HTTP 429), implement retry logic with exponential backoff. For example, after a failed request, wait 2 seconds, then double the wait time with each subsequent attempt (4 seconds, 8 seconds, etc.). This prevents your integration from overwhelming the CRM API during temporary outages.\n\n## Monitoring & Testing\n\nTrack key metrics, including success rates per endpoint, average and 95th percentile API latency, records synced per hour, and webhook event outcomes. Set up alerts via tools like email, Slack, or PagerDuty for issues such as error rates exceeding 2–5% over five minutes, increasing webhook backlogs, or rising latency.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0b9cb4d5-4e45-49e2-b7ab-7985620bda5b","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:10:31.491Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"2bc54535-d611-4e44-a1ca-2b742af212a9"}

Email Automation with A/B Testing\n\n### Platform Comparison: SendGrid vs. Postmark vs. Amazon SES\n\n| Feature | SendGrid | Postmark | Amazon SES |\n|---------|----------|----------|------------|\n| **A/B Testing** | Built-in, robust | Not a core feature | Not included; build your own |\n| **Marketing Automation** | Yes (campaigns, segmentation) | No (transactional only) | No |\n| **API Quality** | Excellent SDKs (Python, Node, etc.) | Clean, simple API | Powerful but requires more setup |\n| **Deliverability** | High | Very high (transactional focus) | High (if configured properly) |\n| **Pricing** | Mid-range | Premium | Cheapest at scale ($0.10/1K emails) |\n| **Best For** | Marketing + transactional hybrid | Transactional reliability | High-volume, cost-sensitive sends |\n\n**Recommendation pattern**: Use **SendGrid** for marketing emails with A/B testing and segmentation. Use **Postmark** for transactional emails (password resets, receipts) where deliverability is critical. Use **Amazon SES** as the cost-effective backbone for high-volume sends, but expect to build tracking, suppression, and A/B testing yourself.\n\n### AI-Powered All-in-One Platforms\n\n- **HubSpot Marketing Hub** with Breeze AI (2025): CRM + email + automation + AI copilot for generating blog posts, social copy, and email subject lines.\n- **ActiveCampaign**: Strong email marketing automation with AI-driven send-time optimization.\n- **Omnisend**: Email + SMS + push for eCommerce, with built-in A/B testing.\n- **Gumloop**: Connects any LLM (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) to internal tools and workflows without code.\n\n---\n\n## 2. LinkedIn Outreach Assistants (Compliance-Safe)\n\n### Recommended Tools\n\n| Tool | Approach | Key Feature |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| **Cognism** | Sales intelligence platform | GDPR/CCPA compliant, Cortex AI, global DNC lists |\n| **Outreachly** | AI-powered LinkedIn + email | Writes campaign content, smart replies, auto-comments |\n| **Closely** | Human-like automation | Smart limits, delays, human-like timing |\n| **Konnector.AI** | Hybrid execution model | Browser-based actions + cloud-orchestrated logic |\n| **Reachy.ai** | AI outreach alternative | Smarter personalization |\n\n### LinkedIn Limits (2025-2026)\n\n- **Connection requests**: 100-200/week (15-30/day); stay under 80/week without Sales Navigator\n- **Messages to connections**: Up to 150/day\n- **Messages to non-connections**: 10 message requests/week\n- **Profile views**: 500/day (free), 2,000/day (premium)\n- **Acceptance rate threshold**: Below 30% triggers spam classification and restriction\n\n### Compliance Rules\n\n- LinkedIn bans **patterns**, not tools. Automation mimicking focused human work survives; bulk processing does not.\n- Avoid identical copy, aggressive timing, and generic follow-ups.\n- Maintain high acceptance rates (above 30%) to avoid \"LinkedIn Jail\" (24 hours to several days restriction).\n- Personalization is mandatory; LinkedIn's message filters watch for velocity, repetition, and generic text.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Content Creation Tools\n\n### For LinkedIn\n\n- **Jasper AI**: Brand-tone-aware content generation for posts and articles.\n- **Supergrow.ai**: LinkedIn-specific AI content creation and scheduling.\n- **ChatGPT / Claude**: Long-form drafts, thought leadership posts.\n- **Buffer**: AI-assisted social media content creation and scheduling.\n\n### For Xiaohongshu (小红书)\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| **Hongshu Zhiyu (洪书智语)** | Graphic + text copy generation; library of 15M+ popular copy examples |\n| **Reditor Editor** | One-stop note creation: editing, formatting, content checking |\n| **XHSPlus** | AI-powered operation analytics and strategy optimization |\n| **Shutu Bao (数图宝)** | Bulk graphic + text generation for high-volume operators |\n\n### Xiaohongshu Content Strategy for Startup Recruitment\n\n- **Algorithm (2025 update)**: Content visibility uses a weighted contribution model rewarding consistency and community engagement.\n- **Originality requirement**: Posts must be at least 60% original for broader promotion.\n- **Content ecosystem**: Leverage UGC, KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders), and KOCs (Key Opinion Consumers) for authentic engagement.\n- **Recruitment angle**: Position startup culture content as lifestyle content (office tours, team stories, day-in-the-life) rather than traditional job postings. The platform's user base is primarily young urban Chinese Millennials and Gen Z.\n- **Post-TikTok-ban surge**: Following the TikTok ban in January 2025, overseas user migration to Xiaohongshu has accelerated, making it viable for international startup recruitment.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Lead Enrichment & Scoring Tools\n\n### Top Platforms\n\n| Tool | Strength | Key Feature |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| **Apollo.io** | All-in-one prospecting | 275M+ contacts, 70M companies, buyer intent signals, built-in engagement tools |\n| **Clearbit** (now part of HubSpot) | Real-time enrichment | Firmographic + technographic data, API-first |\n| **Default** | Inbound orchestration | AI-powered lead matching with fuzzy logic, instant enrichment + routing |\n| **Warmly** | Intent-based scoring | 10+ enrichment sources, real-time score updates, Slack alerts for hot leads |\n| **ZoomInfo** | Enterprise enrichment | Comprehensive B2B database, intent data |\n| **Cognism** | GDPR-compliant data | Phone-verified contacts, global compliance |\n\n### AI Lead Scoring Best Practices\n\n- ML models analyze hundreds of data points simultaneously (engagement, firmographics, behavior history).\n- Scores update in real-time as new signals arrive.\n- Continuous learning: models retrain on which combinations predict conversion.\n- Look for native bi-directional CRM integrations so scoring data flows to sales tools automatically.\n\n---\n\n## 5. CRM Integration Patterns\n\n### Architecture Patterns\n\n**Hybrid Model (recommended)**:\n- **Webhooks** for real-time event triggers (lead created, deal stage changed, form submitted).\n- **REST APIs** for bulk synchronization, historical loads, complex queries, and controlled write-backs.\n- **Batch sync** for large operations to optimize efficiency.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Idempotent event handlers**: Verify unique identifiers (contact_id + event_id) to prevent duplicate processing.\n2. **Retry logic with exponential backoff**: For HTTP 429 / transient errors, wait 2s then double (4s, 8s, etc.).\n3. **Webhook evaluation criteria**: Check retry behavior, event history/replay support, payload completeness, and API rate limits.\n4. **Data hygiene**: Eliminate duplicate records, maintain consistent field mapping between systems.\n5. **Monitoring**: Track success rates per endpoint, 95th percentile API latency, records synced per hour, webhook event outcomes. Alert on error rates exceeding 2-5% over five minutes.\n\n### Key Integrations to Build\n\n- Marketing automation to CRM (lead scoring, campaign attribution)\n- CRM to email platform (personalization, segmentation)\n- Enrichment tools to CRM (firmographic data append)\n- CRM to Slack/Teams (hot lead alerts)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Email Deliverability: SPF, DKIM, DMARC\n\n### Current Requirements (2025-2026)\n\n- **Google & Yahoo**: All senders must have SPF and DKIM. Bulk senders (5,000+/day) must also have DMARC.\n- **Microsoft Outlook**: Made SPF, DKIM, and DMARC mandatory as of May 2025.\n- Authenticated senders are **2.7x more likely** to reach the inbox.\n\n### Setup Sequence\n\n1. **SPF first**: Add a TXT record listing authorized sending IPs/services. Max 10 DNS lookups. Use `-all` for strict enforcement (or `~all` during testing). Never use `+all`.\n2. **DKIM next**: Use **2048-bit keys**, rotate periodically, align with your sending domain.\n3. **DMARC last**: Start with `p=none` (monitoring only) with reporting (`rua` and `ruf` tags). Analyze reports to inventory all senders. Gradually tighten: `p=none` then `p=quarantine` then `p=reject`. Never jump straight to `p=reject`.\n\n### Additional Deliverability Practices\n\n- Implement one-click unsubscribe (required for promotional email).\n- Maintain list hygiene: remove bounces, honor complaints immediately.\n- Warm up new sending domains/IPs gradually.\n- Monitor sender reputation via Google Postmaster Tools.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Recommendation Stack\n\nFor an AI-powered marketing automation stack in 2025-2026:\n\n| Layer | Tool(s) |\n|-------|---------|\n| **CRM** | HubSpot (with Breeze AI) or Salesforce (with Einstein) |\n| **Email - Marketing** | SendGrid or HubSpot native |\n| **Email - Transactional** | Postmark or Amazon SES |\n| **LinkedIn Outreach** | Cognism + Closely (compliance-safe) |\n| **Content - LinkedIn** | Jasper AI or Claude API |\n| **Content - Xiaohongshu** | Hongshu Zhiyu + Reditor Editor |\n| **Lead Enrichment** | Apollo.io or Clearbit |\n| **Lead Scoring** | Warmly or HubSpot native |\n| **Workflow Automation** | Gumloop (LLM connector) or n8n/Make |\n| **Analytics** | XHSPlus (Xiaohongshu) + native CRM analytics |\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [26 Best AI Marketing Tools - Marketer Milk](https://www.marketermilk.com/blog/ai-marketing-tools)\n- [30+ Best AI Marketing Automation Tools (Categorized)](https://bit-flows.com/blog/best-ai-marketing-automation-tools/)\n- [7 LinkedIn AI Tools to Boost Outreach - Cognism](https://www.cognism.com/blog/linkedin-ai-tools)\n- [LinkedIn Automation in 2026: Safe Tools & Limits](https://konnector.ai/linkedin-automation-2026/)\n- [LinkedIn Limits in 2026 - LeadLoft](https://www.leadloft.com/blog/linkedin-limits)\n- [LinkedIn Automation Daily Limits 2025 - Closely](https://blog.closelyhq.com/linkedin-automation-daily-limits-the-2025-safety-guidelines/)\n- [11 Lead Enrichment Tools (2026 Update)](https://www.default.com/post/lead-enrichment-tools)\n- [AI Lead Scoring Tools 2026 - Warmly](https://www.warmly.ai/p/blog/ai-lead-scoring-tools)\n- [Top 12 Lead Enrichment Tools for GTM 2026 - Warmly](https://www.warmly.ai/p/blog/lead-enrichment-tools)\n- [Xiaohongshu Strategy 2026 - Marketing to China](https://marketingtochina.com/xiaohongshu-little-red-book-the-definitive-guide-for-advanced-marketers/)\n- [2025 Xiaohongshu Algorithm Update](https://chinamarketingcorp.com/blog/2025-xiaohongshu-algorithm-update-what-global-brands-need-to-know/)\n- [Five AI Tools for Xiaohongshu Content Creation](https://www.oreateai.com/blog/five-efficient-ai-tools-to-assist-in-content-creation-for-xiaohongshu-and-xiluoshu/52f234627e32f181a9e2a9d79f8e3c95)\n- [Email Deliverability 2026: SPF, DKIM, DMARC Checklist](https://www.egenconsulting.com/blog/email-deliverability-2026.html)\n- [SPF DKIM DMARC Best Practices 2026 - SalesHive](https://saleshive.com/blog/dkim-dmarc-spf-best-practices-email-security-deliverability/)\n- [SPF DKIM DMARC Best Practices 2026 - URIports](https://www.uriports.com/blog/spf-dkim-dmarc-best-practices/)\n- [Postmark vs SendGrid Comparison 2025](https://postmarkapp.com/compare/sendgrid-alternative)\n- [Amazon SES vs SendGrid 2025](https://fluentsmtp.com/articles/amazon-ses-vs-sendgrid/)\n- [CRM and Marketing Automation Integration Best Practices 2025 - Act-On](https://act-on.com/learn/blog/best-practices-crm-marketing-automation-integration/)\n- [Webhook vs API for CRM Integration](https://www.codelessplatforms.com/webhook-vs-api-for-crm-integration/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4168,"cache_read_input_tokens":20100,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4168,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY8xqGs5mgZBe99CwTov2","type":"assistant","uuid":"83c1552f-beb5-4abd-8071-19ab330fe2fd","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:11:41.303Z"}
