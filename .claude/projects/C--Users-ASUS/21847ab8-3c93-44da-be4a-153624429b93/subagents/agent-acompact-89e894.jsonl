The conversation started as a continuation from a previous session that hit a rate limit. The user had asked me to create a \"GrowthOps Agent\" plan for PitchTok - a TikTok-style VC deal sourcing platform.\n\n2. I read the previous conversation transcript to understand the original task. The user's original request was very detailed - they wanted a production-level marketing automation tool similar to OpenClaw that could handle: 小红书运营, LinkedIn冷启动, lead list building, email automation, A/B testing, etc.\n\n3. I launched 4 parallel research agents: OpenClaw research, marketing tools, founder discovery, AI agent architectures.\n\n4. After those completed (output files were empty but agents reported success), I did direct web searches for OpenClaw and marketing tools.\n\n5. I launched 3 more perspective agents: Senior Engineer, Growth Hacker, Security Reviewer.\n\n6. I synthesized everything into a comprehensive GrowthOps Agent Plan delivered directly in the conversation with 10 main sections + sources.\n\n7. As agent results came back (all 7 eventually completed), I added Appendices A-F with additional intelligence.\n\n8. User asked \"where i can see this history because right now it's in terminal\" - I saved the full plan to Desktop as GrowthOps_Agent_Plan.md.\n\n9. User asked \"what i should do for this\" - I gave them a prioritized action plan (today, this week, this month).\n\n10. User clarified: \"so my job is only to get as many founders as i can by using this automational tool\" - I simplified the plan to focus on founder acquisition only.\n\n11. User asked \"can your previous GrowthOps_Agent_Plan do things below automatically?\" listing XHS operations, LinkedIn cold start, lead lists, A/B testing, etc. I gave an honest breakdown: ~70% automated, ~30% manual (due to platform restrictions).\n\n12. User asked \"Does this plan work as same as Openclaw - based on human's command and it will open APP and do the commend for me\" - I was honest: NO, the plan is just a document, not a running agent.\n\n13. User asked \"this plan is to make an ai agent that works as same as openclaw?\" - I confirmed NO, it's a strategy document, not working software. Recommended using OpenClaw directly.\n\n14. User then said they want to USE OpenClaw to do all the marketing tasks, and wanted me to create skills for it. They listed many automation tasks and said to think of ALL possible marketing tactics.\n\n15. I launched 3 research agents: OpenClaw skill format, ALL marketing tactics brainstorm, existing OpenClaw skills.\n\n16. User sent additional messages: \"openclaw should do all the tasks in the GrowthOps_Agent_Plan\" and \"it should be the productive-level, taking it seriously\" and pasted the entire GrowthOps plan as reference.\n\n17. I checked and found OpenClaw IS installed (v2026.2.13) at C:\\Users\\ASUS\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\openclaw, with config at ~/.openclaw/identity/device.json but NO skills yet.\n\n18. I researched OpenClaw skill format via web (docs.openclaw.ai), learned SKILL.md YAML frontmatter format, directory structure (~/.openclaw/skills/), cron job system, browser automation capabilities.\n\n19. I created the SOUL.md file at C:\\Users\\ASUS\\.openclaw\\SOUL.md\n\n20. I created 17 skill directories under C:\\Users\\ASUS\\.openclaw\\skills/\n\n21. I started writing SKILL.md files - completed 5 so far:\n    - growthops-founder-finder\n    - growthops-email-engine\n    - growthops-xhs-content\n    - growthops-linkedin-ops\n    - growthops-lead-scorer\n\n22. Still need to write 12 more skills:\n    - growthops-ab-testing\n    - growthops-analytics\n    - growthops-dm-outreach\n    - growthops-translator\n    - growthops-comment-monitor\n    - growthops-phone-outreach\n    - growthops-content-repurposer\n    - growthops-referral-engine\n    - growthops-event-hunter\n    - growthops-competitor-monitor\n    - growthops-seo-content\n    - growthops-weekly-report\n\nPlus need to set up cron jobs for automated scheduling.\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user works in the marketing department of PitchTok, a TikTok-style VC deal sourcing platform. Their sole job is to find as many US-based early-stage founders as possible and get them to upload pitch videos. \n   \n   The conversation evolved through several phases:\n   - **Phase 1**: Create a comprehensive \"GrowthOps Agent\" plan (strategy document) matching OpenClaw's capabilities - COMPLETED\n   - **Phase 2**: Save the plan to Desktop - COMPLETED\n   - **Phase 3**: User realized the plan is just a document, not working software. Pivoted to: **Use OpenClaw directly and create custom skills** that implement ALL tasks from the GrowthOps plan\n   - **Phase 4 (CURRENT)**: Create 17+ OpenClaw skills, SOUL.md, and cron jobs to automate: email outreach, 小红书 content ops, LinkedIn cold start, founder discovery, lead scoring, A/B testing, comment monitoring, auto-translation, phone outreach, content repurposing, referral engine, event hunting, competitor monitoring, SEO content, weekly reports, and DM outreach. User explicitly wants to go BEYOND the original plan - \"think of all the possible ways that human would do when doing marketing\"\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - OpenClaw v2026.2.13 (installed on user's machine via npm)\n   - OpenClaw SKILL.md format: YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools, metadata) + Markdown body instructions\n   - OpenClaw SOUL.md: Agent identity, personality, goals, boundaries, memory configuration\n   - OpenClaw cron jobs: `openclaw cron add` with `--cron`, `--at`, `--every` scheduling, isolated vs main session, delivery to Slack/WhatsApp/etc.\n   - OpenClaw browser automation: CDP-based, snapshot/click/type/navigate/screenshot capabilities\n   - OpenClaw skill directory: `~/.openclaw/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`\n   - OpenClaw workspace: persistent markdown files for memory/state\n   - SendGrid API for email automation\n   - Apollo.io API for lead enrichment (210M+ contacts)\n   - PitchTok ICP: US-based founders, idea/MVP/seed stage, raised <$2M, AI/SaaS/FinTech/DevTools verticals\n   - CAN-SPAM, GDPR, CCPA compliance requirements\n   - LinkedIn ToS: NO automation, draft-only approach\n   - 小红书 rules: NO auto-posting, 60%+ original content, manual posting required\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **C:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\GrowthOps_Agent_Plan.md**\n     - The complete strategy document with 10 sections + 6 appendices\n     - ~1500 lines covering architecture, modules, templates, implementation plan, security\n     - Created as reference for OpenClaw skill implementation\n\n   - **C:\\Users\\ASUS\\.openclaw\\SOUL.md** (CREATED)\n     - OpenClaw agent identity configuration for PitchTok GrowthOps\n     - Defines: Identity, Core Truths, PitchTok description, Target ICP, Communication Style, Boundaries, Memory patterns, Daily Rhythm\n     - Key sections include forbidden actions (no LinkedIn bots, no XHS auto-posting) and allowed actions (SendGrid email, web browsing, content generation)\n\n   - **C:\\Users\\ASUS\\.openclaw\\skills\\growthops-founder-finder\\SKILL.md** (CREATED)\n     - Searches Product Hunt, Apollo.io API, Hacker News, GitHub Trending, Indie Hackers, Twitter, Reddit, BetaList, Crunchbase\n     - Includes Apollo.io API curl command with filters for founders/CEOs, US location, 1-10 employees\n     - Outputs leads to `workspace/leads/YYYY-MM-DD-new-leads.md` with structured format\n     - Target: 20-50 new founders per run\n\n   - **C:\\Users\\ASUS\\.openclaw\\skills\\growthops-email-engine\\SKILL.md** (CREATED)\n     - Full email automation via SendGrid API with 3-email sequence templates\n     - Includes warmup schedule (5/day week 1 → 150/day week 8+)\n     - A/B testing (50/50 split, declare winner after 100 sends)\n     - Suppression list management, CAN-SPAM compliance\n     - SendGrid API curl command included\n     - Tracks state in workspace/email/ directory\n\n   - **C:\\Users\\ASUS\\.openclaw\\skills\\growthops-xhs-content\\SKILL.md** (CREATED)\n     - 小红书 content generation: topics, scripts, captions, hashtags\n     - 8 proven hook templates in Chinese\n     - Short (15-30s) and Long (45-60s) script structures\n     - Ready-to-post pack format with copy-paste sections\n     - Quality checks, posting schedule (3x/week), content pillars\n     - DM templates for engagers\n\n   - **C:\\Users\\ASUS\\.openclaw\\skills\\growthops-linkedin-ops\\SKILL.md** (CREATED)\n     - CRITICAL RULE: NEVER automate LinkedIn, draft-only\n     - LinkedIn post generation (3/week): Monday tactical, Wednesday hot take, Friday case study\n     - Connection request templates (≤300 chars) for founder and investor lanes\n     - DM sequence (3 messages over 7 days)\n     - Daily outreach queue format (20 profiles/day)\n     - Safety limits: 5 connections/day, 10 messages/day\n\n   - **C:\\Users\\ASUS\\.openclaw\\skills\\growthops-lead-scorer\\SKILL.md** (CREATED)\n     - 0-100 point scoring with positive signals (stage, geo, vertical, recency, engagement, source) and negative signals\n     - Four tiers: HOT (60+), WARM (35-59), COLD (15-34), DISQUALIFIED (<15)\n     - Routing rules per tier\n     - Re-scoring on new data (reply, click, bounce)\n\n   - **C:\\Users\\ASUS\\.openclaw\\identity\\device.json** (READ ONLY)\n     - OpenClaw device identity with public/private keys\n     - Confirms OpenClaw is properly installed\n\n   - **12 empty skill directories created** (SKILL.md files NOT yet written):\n     - growthops-ab-testing\n     - growthops-analytics\n     - growthops-dm-outreach\n     - growthops-translator\n     - growthops-comment-monitor\n     - growthops-phone-outreach\n     - growthops-content-repurposer\n     - growthops-referral-engine\n     - growthops-event-hunter\n     - growthops-competitor-monitor\n     - growthops-seo-content\n     - growthops-weekly-report\n\n4. Errors and Fixes:\n   - Agent output files were empty (1-line files) despite agents completing successfully. TaskOutput returned \"completed\" but output files at `C:\\Users\\ASUS\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\claude\\C--Users-ASUS\\tasks\\*.output` were blank.

Review the previous GrowthOps_Agent_Plan and make a finest plan for me. think of all the possible ways that human would do when doing the marketing.I want that to implenment to OpenClaw.\"\n   - \"openclaw should do all the tasks in the GrowthOps_Agent_Plan\"\n   - \"it should be the productive-level, taking it seriously\"\n   - [User pasted the entire GrowthOps_Agent_Plan.md as a message with note: \"here are references. I hope openclaw can do more than these.\"]\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Write SKILL.md files for remaining 12 skills: ab-testing, analytics, dm-outreach, translator, comment-monitor, phone-outreach, content-repurposer, referral-engine, event-hunter, competitor-monitor, seo-content, weekly-report\n   - Set up OpenClaw cron jobs for automated scheduling (daily founder finding, email sequences, weekly reports, content generation)\n   - Create workspace directory structure for OpenClaw data persistence\n   - Potentially set up API keys (.env or OpenClaw config) for SendGrid, Apollo.io\n   - Test that OpenClaw loads the skills correctly\n   - The user wants MORE tactics beyond what's in the original plan - the brainstorming agent completed but results weren't captured; need to incorporate additional marketing tactics\n\n8. Current Work:\n   I was actively creating OpenClaw SKILL.md files. I had just finished writing 5 out of 17 planned skills (founder-finder, email-engine, xhs-content, linkedin-ops, lead-scorer) and was about to write the remaining 12 skill files when the summary was requested.\n\n   The 12 remaining skills to create are:\n   - growthops-ab-testing (experiment tracking and winner selection)\n   - growthops-analytics (metrics tracking, KPI dashboards)\n   - growthops-dm-outreach (DM templates for XHS and LinkedIn)\n   - growthops-translator (auto-translate content across platforms/languages)\n   - growthops-comment-monitor (watch comments on all posts, auto-reply)\n   - growthops-phone-outreach (call scripts, call task lists)\n   - growthops-content-repurposer (1 post → multiple platform formats)\n   - growthops-referral-engine (referral programs, viral loops)\n   - growthops-event-hunter (find conferences, meetups, pitch competitions)\n   - growthops-competitor-monitor (track competitor activity)\n   - growthops-seo-content (blog posts, SEO optimization)\n   - growthops-weekly-report (automated performance reports)\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Continue writing the remaining 12 SKILL.md files for OpenClaw, then set up cron jobs for automated scheduling. The user's explicit request was: \"I want to use more ways to increase number of founders to use our product, not only limited to my ideas above, ultrathink... think of all the possible ways that human would do when doing the marketing. I want that to implement to OpenClaw.\" and \"it should be the productive-level, taking it seriously\" and \"openclaw should do all the tasks in the GrowthOps_Agent_Plan.\"\n\n   Immediately before the summary, I had just written the 5th skill (growthops-lead-scorer) and needed to continue with the remaining 12 skills + cron job setup.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":18270,"cache_read_input_tokens":155457,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":18270,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY95cCfmt3VqK89cEhTKt","type":"assistant","uuid":"be318551-4e1f-4493-9530-18e04578182b","timestamp":"2026-02-15T02:41:00.741Z"}
