Public Startup Directories and Databases\n\n### Crunchbase\n- **What it offers**: The largest startup database with funding rounds, founder profiles, company details, and investor information.\n- **API**: Crunchbase Basic API (free tier available) and Crunchbase Enterprise API. Filter by funding stage (Pre-Seed, Seed), location (US), and founding date.\n- **Key filters**: \"Founded after 2024\", \"Total funding < $500K\", \"Headquarters: United States\"\n- **Pricing**: Free basic search; Pro starts at ~$49/month; Enterprise API pricing varies.\n- **URL**: https://www.crunchbase.com\n\n### Product Hunt\n- **What it offers**: Daily launches of new products -- founders actively seeking visibility are already here. These are ideal PitchTok candidates because they are already comfortable with public-facing promotion.\n- **API**: Product Hunt GraphQL API (requires OAuth token). Pull daily/weekly launches, maker profiles, upvote counts.\n- **Strategy**: Target makers who launched in the last 6 months with moderate traction (50-500 upvotes) -- they are hungry for funding but not yet well-funded.\n- **URL**: https://www.producthunt.com\n\n### Wellfound (formerly AngelList Talent)\n- **What it offers**: Startup job board and founder profiles. Founders list themselves and their startups.\n- **API**: Limited public API; web scraping (with caution -- see legal section) or manual outreach.\n- **Strategy**: Filter startups by stage (\"Pre-Seed\", \"Seed\"), employee count (1-10), and location.\n- **URL**: https://wellfound.com\n\n### Y Combinator Directory\n- **What it offers**: Public directory of all YC companies across all batches.\n- **API**: No official API, but the directory at https://www.ycombinator.com/companies is publicly browsable and filterable.\n- **Strategy**: Filter by batch (recent batches like W25, S25), industry, and status (\"Active\"). Also check https://news.ycombinator.com (Hacker News) \"Launch HN\" posts for brand-new YC companies.\n- **Bonus**: YC Co-Founder Matching platform participants are actively looking to build -- they may be pre-company founders.\n\n### PitchBook\n- **What it offers**: Comprehensive VC/PE database with detailed funding data.\n- **Pricing**: Enterprise-level (expensive, $20K+/year), but very thorough.\n- **Best for**: If PitchTok secures VC backing and needs institutional-grade data.\n\n### Additional Directories\n- **BetaList** (https://betalist.com) -- startups in beta stage, very early.\n- **Launching Next** (https://launchingnext.com) -- early-stage startups seeking exposure.\n- **F6S** (https://f6s.com) -- global startup platform with founder profiles and accelerator applications.\n- **Indie Hackers** (https://indiehackers.com) -- solo founders and bootstrapped startups, many open to funding.\n- **StartupList Africa / US equivalents** -- niche directories.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Founder Community Platforms\n\n### Online Communities (High-Intent Founders)\n\n| Platform | Where to Find Founders | Signal Quality |\n|----------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **Indie Hackers** | Forums, product pages, milestones | Very high -- founders share revenue, challenges |\n| **Hacker News** | \"Show HN\", \"Launch HN\", \"Ask HN: Review my startup\" | High -- technical founders |\n| **Reddit** | r/startups, r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness, r/indiehackers | Medium-high -- active discussion |\n| **Twitter/X** | #buildinpublic, #indiehackers, #startup, founder threads | High -- founders self-identify |\n| **Discord** | Startup School discord, YC alumni channels, niche founder servers | High -- real-time engagement |\n| **Slack Communities** | Founders Network, Launch House alumni, On Deck alumni channels | Very high -- curated communities |\n\n### Key Slack/Discord Communities\n- **Startup School by YC** -- Free, thousands of early-stage founders.\n- **On Deck Founders (ODF)** -- Alumni network, high-quality founders.\n- **South Park Commons** -- Technical founders exploring ideas.\n- **Pioneer** -- Global founder community with leaderboard.\n- **Lenny's Newsletter Community** -- Product-focused founders.\n\n### Strategy for Communities\n1. Join these communities authentically (not just to scrape).\n2. Offer value first (e.g., \"We built a platform to help founders pitch to VCs via short video -- looking for beta testers\").\n3. Identify founders who post about fundraising, MVPs, or looking for feedback.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Conference and Event Attendee Lists\n\n### Major Startup Events (US-focused)\n- **TechCrunch Disrupt** -- Startup Battlefield participants are ideal (public list of competing startups).\n- **SXSW Interactive** -- Pitch competitions, startup showcases.\n- **CES Eureka Park** -- Hardware/consumer startups.\n- **Demo Day events** -- YC, Techstars, 500 Global, and other accelerator demo days (often livestreamed with founder names).\n- **Startup Grind Global Conference** -- Large founder attendance.\n- **Web Summit** (Alpha/Beta programs for early startups).\n\n### Finding Attendees\n- **Eventbrite API**: Search for startup/founder events, retrieve public attendee info where available.\n- **Luma** (https://lu.ma): Many startup events are hosted here; event pages often list speakers/participants.\n- **Meetup.com API**: Find local startup meetups, pitch nights, founder dinners.\n- **Accelerator demo day recordings**: YouTube/Vimeo recordings of demo days list founder names and companies.\n- **Conference speaker lists**: Most conferences publish speaker/presenter bios publicly.\n\n### Pitch Competition Databases\n- **Pitchforce**, **Startup Battlefield archives**, **Rice Business Plan Competition**, **MassChallenge** -- all publish finalist/winner lists publicly.\n\n---\n\n## 4. GitHub and Open-Source Signals for Technical Founders\n\n### Identifying Technical Founders on GitHub\n- **GitHub API** (REST + GraphQL): Search for users by location, language, followers, and repository activity.\n- **Signals of a founder**:\n  - User has a repo that looks like a product (not just a library) -- e.g., a SaaS app, mobile app, or developer tool.\n  - Repo has a landing page or domain linked.\n  - User's bio mentions \"founder\", \"CEO\", \"building X\", or links to a startup website.\n  - Recent spike in commits (building something new).\n  - Repo has a `FUNDING.yml` or GitHub Sponsors enabled.\n\n### GitHub Search Queries\n```\n# Find users in the US with \"founder\" in their bio\nGET /search/users?q=founder+location:US+type:user\n\n# Find repos with \"startup\" in description, recently created\nGET /search/repositories?q=startup+created:>2025-01-01&sort=stars\n```\n\n### Tools\n- **GitHub API** (free, 5000 requests/hour authenticated): https://docs.github.com/en/rest\n- **GH Archive** (https://gharchive.org): Historical GitHub event data for bulk analysis.\n- **OSS Insight** (https://ossinsight.io): Analytics on GitHub repos and contributors.\n- **Star History** (https://star-history.com): Track repo growth -- fast-growing repos may indicate startups.\n\n### Strategy\n1. Search for repos created in last 12 months with product-like characteristics.\n2. Cross-reference repo owners with LinkedIn to confirm founder status.\n3. Look for repos with landing pages, pricing pages, or \"YC S25\" in README.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Social Media Signals for Founder Identification\n\n### Twitter/X\n- **Key hashtags**: #buildinpublic, #indiehackers, #startup, #founders, #saas, #mvp, #fundraising, #pitchdeck, #yc, #techstartup\n- **Key accounts to monitor**: @ycombinator, @techstars, @producthunt (for launch announcements)\n- **Twitter/X API v2**: Search tweets by keyword, filter by user location, engagement metrics.\n  - Endpoint: `GET /2/tweets/search/recent?query=#buildinpublic`\n  - Pricing: Basic tier ~$100/month, Pro tier ~$5,000/month for higher volume.\n- **Strategy**: Identify users who tweet about building products, sharing MRR milestones, or asking for co-founders. These are self-selecting early-stage founders.\n- **Tools**: \n  - **Apify Twitter Scraper** -- for collecting tweets matching keywords.\n  - **Phantombuster** -- Twitter profile scraper and auto-engagement.\n  - **Tweet Hunter / Taplio** -- Find and engage with founders on Twitter.\n\n### LinkedIn\n- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**: The gold standard for finding founders by title, company size, industry, and geography.\n  - Filter: Title contains \"Founder\" OR \"Co-founder\" OR \"CEO\", Company headcount 1-10, Location United States, Company founded date last 2 years.\n  - Pricing: ~$100/month (Sales Navigator Core).\n- **LinkedIn API**: Very restricted for scraping. Official API requires partnership approval.\n- **Tools for LinkedIn outreach**:\n  - **Apollo.io** -- Find founders with verified emails from LinkedIn profiles. Free tier: 50 credits/month. Paid: from $49/month.\n  - **Phantombuster** -- LinkedIn profile scraper, connection request automation.\n  - **Lemlist / Instantly** -- Cold email sequences with LinkedIn integration.\n  - **Dripify** -- LinkedIn automation for outreach.\n- **Strategy**: Search for founders who recently changed their title to \"Founder\" or \"CEO\" (signal they just started a company).\n\n### Reddit\n- **Subreddits**: r/startups (500K+ members), r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS, r/indiehackers, r/smallbusiness, r/venturecapital\n- **Reddit API**: Free, generous rate limits. Search posts by subreddit, keyword, flair.\n- **Strategy**: Monitor posts tagged \"Feedback\", \"Show /r/startups\", or users asking about fundraising. These founders are actively seeking visibility.\n- **Tools**: **Apify Reddit Scraper**, or direct Reddit API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Legal and Ethical Considerations\n\n### CRITICAL: Compliance Framework\n\n| Area | Rule | Risk |\n|------|------|------|\n| **CAN-SPAM Act** | Cold emails must include opt-out mechanism, physical address, honest subject lines | Fines up to $51,744 per email violation |\n| **CCPA (California)** | California residents have right to know what data is collected, right to delete | Fines up to $7,500 per intentional violation |\n| **GDPR** (if any EU founders) | Requires lawful basis for processing, right to erasure | Fines up to 4% of global revenue |\n| **CFAA** | Do not circumvent access controls when scraping | Criminal penalties possible |\n| **LinkedIn ToS** | Scraping LinkedIn profiles violates ToS (though hiQ v. LinkedIn ruled public data scraping is not illegal under CFAA) | Account bans, potential civil suits |\n| **Website ToS** | Always check robots.txt and terms of service before scraping | Civil liability |\n\n### Best Practices\n1. **Use official APIs** wherever possible (Product Hunt, Crunchbase, GitHub, Twitter, Reddit all have APIs).\n2. **Respect rate limits** and robots.txt.\n3. **Do not scrape** LinkedIn directly -- use official partners like Apollo, Clearbit, or LinkedIn Sales Navigator.\n4. **Obtain consent** before adding founders to marketing lists. The best approach: reach out individually with a clear value proposition.\n5. **Provide opt-out** in every communication.\n6. **Store data securely** and have a privacy policy.\n7. **Public data doctrine**: Data that founders voluntarily make public (tweets, Product Hunt launches, GitHub profiles, blog posts) is generally fair to collect, but always provide transparency about how you found them.\n\n### Recommended Approach for PitchTok\n- **Inbound-first**: Create compelling content/ads targeting founders; let them come to you.\n- **Permission-based outreach**: When doing outbound, use verified business emails (not personal), reference specific public content they created, and make opt-out easy.\n- **Partner with accelerators**: Get official introductions rather than cold scraping.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Lead Enrichment Tools\n\n### Finding Emails from Names/Companies\n\n| Tool | What It Does | Pricing | API Available |\n|------|-------------|---------|---------------|\n| **Apollo.io** | Email finder, company data, LinkedIn enrichment | Free tier (50 credits/mo), paid from $49/mo | Yes |\n| **Hunter.io** | Email finder by domain, email verification | Free tier (25 searches/mo), paid from $49/mo | Yes |\n| **Clearbit** (now part of HubSpot) | Company and person enrichment from email/domain | Contact sales (was ~$99/mo+) | Yes |\n| **Snov.io** | Email finder, drip campaigns, email verification | Free tier, paid from $39/mo | Yes |\n| **RocketReach** | Email/phone finder from name + company | From $53/mo | Yes |\n| **Dropcontact** | GDPR-compliant email enrichment (EU-friendly) | From ~$24/mo | Yes |\n| **Prospeo** | LinkedIn email finder, domain search | From $39/mo | Yes |\n| **Pipl / FullContact** | Identity resolution from partial data | Enterprise pricing | Yes |\n\n### Company Enrichment\n\n| Tool | What It Does | Best For |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Crunchbase API** | Funding, founders, industry, employee count | Startup-specific data |\n| **Clearbit Enrichment** | Company size, tech stack, revenue estimates | B2B enrichment |\n| **BuiltWith** | Technology stack detection from domain | Finding startups using specific tech |\n| **SimilarWeb API** | Website traffic estimates | Gauging traction |\n| **Diffbot** | Knowledge graph of companies and people | Large-scale entity resolution |\n\n---\n\n## 8. API-Based Approaches to Build Founder Lists at Scale\n\n### Architecture for a Founder Discovery Pipeline\n\n```\n[Data Sources] --> [Collection Layer] --> [Enrichment] --> [Scoring] --> [Outreach]\n```\n\n### Recommended Stack\n\n**Collection Layer:**\n```python\n# Example: Multi-source founder discovery\nsources = {\n    \"product_hunt\": ProductHuntGraphQLAPI(),      # Daily launches\n    \"crunchbase\": CrunchbaseAPI(),                 # Funding data\n    \"github\": GitHubRESTAPI(),                     # Technical founders\n    \"twitter\": TwitterAPIv2(),                     # #buildinpublic\n    \"reddit\": RedditAPI(),                         # r/startups posts\n    \"hacker_news\": HackerNewsAPI(),                # Show HN, Launch HN\n    \"betalist\": BetaListScraper(),                 # Beta-stage startups\n}\n```\n\n**Specific APIs and Endpoints:**\n\n1. **Product Hunt GraphQL API**\n   - Endpoint: `https://api.producthunt.com/v2/api/graphql`\n   - Auth: OAuth2\n   - Query: Fetch posts by date, get maker profiles\n   - Rate limit: 450 requests per 15 minutes\n\n2. **Crunchbase API**\n   - Endpoint: `https://api.crunchbase.com/api/v4/`\n   - Auth: API key\n   - Query: `/searches/organizations` with filters for stage, location, founding date\n   - Rate limit: Varies by plan\n\n3. **GitHub API**\n   - Endpoint: `https://api.github.com/`\n   - Auth: Personal access token\n   - Query: `/search/users?q=type:user+location:US+repos:>5+followers:>10`\n   - Rate limit: 5,000 requests/hour (authenticated)\n\n4. **Twitter/X API v2**\n   - Endpoint: `https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent`\n   - Auth: OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token\n   - Query: `#buildinpublic OR #startup OR \"just launched\" -is:retweet lang:en`\n   - Rate limit: Varies by tier\n\n5. **Reddit API**\n   - Endpoint: `https://oauth.reddit.com/`\n   - Auth: OAuth2\n   - Query: `/r/startups/search?q=flair:feedback OR flair:launch`\n   - Rate limit: 60 requests/minute\n\n6. **Hacker News API** (Firebase-based)\n   - Endpoint: `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/`\n   - Auth: None needed\n   - Query: Search for \"Show HN\" and \"Launch HN\" stories\n   - Rate limit: Generous\n\n### Enrichment Layer\n```python\n# Pseudocode for enrichment pipeline\nfor founder in raw_founders:\n    # Step 1: Find email\n    email = apollo.find_email(founder.name, founder.company)\n    \n    # Step 2: Enrich company data\n    company_data = crunchbase.get_organization(founder.company)\n    \n    # Step 3: Get social profiles\n    social = clearbit.enrich_person(email)\n    \n    # Step 4: Score founder-market fit for PitchTok\n    score = score_founder(\n        stage=company_data.funding_stage,\n        traction=company_data.monthly_traffic,\n        social_presence=social.twitter_followers,\n        content_comfort=has_video_content(social),\n        location=\"US\"\n    )\n```\n\n### Scoring Model for PitchTok Relevance\nPrioritize founders who are:\n- **Pre-seed or seed stage** (most likely to need novel fundraising channels)\n- **Already creating content** (blog posts, tweets, videos -- signal they would record a pitch video)\n- **Active in public communities** (Product Hunt, Twitter, Indie Hackers -- comfortable with visibility)\n- **US-based** (for initial market focus)\n- **Recently launched** (within last 12 months -- still actively fundraising)\n- **Solo or small team** (1-5 people -- less likely to have VC connections already)\n\n### Third-Party Aggregation Tools\n- **Clay** (https://clay.com): No-code tool to build lead lists from 75+ data sources, with built-in enrichment. Excellent for this use case. Pricing from $149/month.\n- **Apify** (https://apify.com): Pre-built scrapers for Product Hunt, Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, GitHub. Pay per usage.\n- **Phantombuster** (https://phantombuster.com): Automation for LinkedIn, Twitter, Product Hunt. From $69/month.\n- **Bardeen.ai**: Browser automation for scraping and enrichment workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Recommended Strategy for PitchTok\n\n### Phase 1: Low-Cost, High-Intent (Week 1-2)\n1. **Manually post** in r/startups, Indie Hackers, Hacker News, and Twitter announcing PitchTok and inviting beta founders.\n2. **Scrape Product Hunt** launches from the last 90 days using their API; reach out to makers.\n3. **Monitor #buildinpublic** on Twitter and engage with founders directly.\n4. **Join Startup School Discord** and offer PitchTok as a tool for founders practicing their pitch.\n\n### Phase 2: Systematic Outreach (Week 3-4)\n1. **Set up Clay or Apollo** to build enriched founder lists from Crunchbase + LinkedIn.\n2. **Use Hunter.io** to find emails for Product Hunt makers and Hacker News \"Show HN\" posters.\n3. **Cold email campaign** via Lemlist or Instantly with personalized outreach referencing their specific product/launch.\n4. **Partner with 2-3 accelerators** (Techstars, On Deck, Pioneer) for co-marketing.\n\n### Phase 3: Automated Pipeline (Month 2+)\n1. **Build automated collection** using GitHub Actions or a cron job that pulls from Product Hunt API, Hacker News API, Reddit API, and Twitter API daily.\n2. **Enrich and score** each founder automatically.\n3. **Trigger personalized outreach** for high-scoring founders.\n4. **Track conversion** (who signs up, who uploads a video) to refine scoring model.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Product Hunt and Indie Hackers are your best starting points** -- founders there are already comfortable with public-facing product promotion and would be most receptive to recording pitch videos.\n\n2. **Twitter #buildinpublic is the single richest real-time signal** for early-stage founders actively building and seeking visibility.\n\n3. **Use Apollo.io + Clay as your core toolstack** for enrichment and list building at scale.\n\n4. **Always lead with value in outreach**: \"We help founders get in front of VCs with a 60-second video pitch\" is a compelling proposition for pre-seed founders struggling to get meetings.\n\n5. **Stay legal**: Use APIs, not unauthorized scraping. Use verified business emails. Include opt-out. Reference public content they created to show you did your research.\n\n6. **Inbound will outperform outbound long-term**: Invest in SEO, social content, and accelerator partnerships to create a flywheel where founders find PitchTok organically.\n\nSources:\n- [Crunchbase API Documentation](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs)\n- [Product Hunt API](https://api.producthunt.com/v2/docs)\n- [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)\n- [Twitter API v2 Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)\n- [Apollo.io](https://www.apollo.io/)\n- [Clay](https://www.clay.com/)\n- [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/)\n- [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)\n- [Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/)\n- [Apify](https://apify.com/)\n- [Y Combinator Company Directory](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies)\n- [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/)\n- [BetaList](https://betalist.com/)\n- [FTC CAN-SPAM Act Compliance Guide](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2753,"cache_read_input_tokens":11857,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2753,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY8xoYLCskNrLtKnCDAqU","type":"assistant","uuid":"53b29365-9dfb-4cfb-9581-053eac250fc6","timestamp":"2026-02-15T01:12:09.811Z"}
