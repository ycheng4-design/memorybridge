On XHS (Xiaohongshu), the algorithm evaluates a post's \"interaction velocity\" within the first 2 hours of publication. Every reply from the author within that window counts as an interaction signal and pushes the post into a wider distribution pool. On LinkedIn, the critical window is 1 hour. On Twitter/X, it is 90 minutes. My recommendation: auto-reply to every comment within 5 minutes during the first 2 hours, then shift to a 30-minute cadence afterward.\n\n**Community Manager:** Five minutes? That is a red flag. No human replies to every single comment within 5 minutes. Users will notice the pattern, especially on XHS where the audience is sophisticated about marketing accounts. I have seen accounts get reported and shadowbanned for bot-like reply behavior. You need to stagger replies: the first reply within 3-8 minutes, the second within 10-15, the third within 20-30. Introduce human-like variance.\n\n**Brand Voice Specialist:** I agree with the Community Manager on principle but disagree on the specific concern. The detection risk is not primarily about speed, it is about uniformity. A founder who is excited about their post WILL reply fast. That is authentic. The problem emerges when every reply is the same length, the same tone, the same structure. Speed with variance is fine. Speed with uniformity is death.\n\n**Algorithm Expert:** Fair point. I will revise: reply within 3-12 minutes (randomized) during the golden window, with structural variance in each reply. But I want to emphasize something both of you are underweighting. On XHS specifically, the author replying to a comment generates a notification to the commenter, which increases the chance they reply back. A comment thread with 3+ exchanges gets significantly more algorithmic weight than a single reply. So the goal is not just to reply, it is to engineer a back-and-forth.\n\n**Consensus on Speed:**\n- Golden window: first 2 hours post-publication\n- Reply timing: randomized between 3-12 minutes in golden window, 15-60 minutes after\n- Never reply to all comments at the same timestamp (stagger by 2-5 minutes between replies)\n- Prioritize comments that are most likely to generate a reply chain\n\n---\n\n## Round 2: Reply Length and Structure\n\n**Brand Voice Specialist:** I want to lead this round because length is a voice issue before it is an algorithm issue. Across platforms, OpenClaw's persona is a \"sharp, slightly irreverent startup insider.\" That persona does not write paragraphs in comment replies. Maximum reply length guidelines:\n\n| Platform | Max Length | Ideal Length |\n|----------|-----------|-------------|\n| XHS | 100 characters (Chinese) | 40-60 characters |\n| LinkedIn | 200 characters | 80-120 characters |\n| Twitter/X | 180 characters | 60-100 characters |\n\nAnything longer reads as corporate or bot-like.\n\n**Algorithm Expert:** I need to push back on the XHS number. XHS rewards \"valuable\" comments, and longer replies with substance actually get upvoted by other users. A comment with 3+ likes from other users generates a \"hot comment\" signal that further boosts the post. I would increase the XHS maximum to 150 characters for comments where we are providing genuine insight or information.\n\n**Community Manager:** You are both missing the structural point. Length matters less than format. A 100-character reply that is a wall of text reads differently from a 100-character reply that has a question at the end. My rule: every reply should end with either (a) a question, (b) a strong opinion that invites disagreement, or (c) a specific call to action. This is what drives reply chains, not length.\n\n**Brand Voice Specialist:** Agreed on the structural point, but I want to add: the ratio matters. If 100% of our replies end with a question, that is a pattern. Target 60% question-ending, 25% opinion-ending, 15% pure acknowledgment (for comments that do not warrant engagement).\n\n**Consensus on Length/Structure:**\n- Keep replies concise per platform norms\n- 60% end with a question, 25% with an opinion, 15% with acknowledgment\n- On XHS, allow longer replies (up to 150 chars) when providing substantive insight\n- Never exceed 2 sentences in a single reply\n\n---\n\n## Round 3: Comment Type Taxonomy and Reply Strategy\n\n**Community Manager:** This is where I need to take the lead. Not all comments are equal. I have identified 12 distinct comment types based on intent, and each requires a different reply strategy. Let me walk through them:\n\n**Type 1 - Genuine Question (\"How does PitchTok work for pre-seed founders?\")**\nThis is the highest-value comment. The commenter is self-qualifying as a potential user. Reply with a direct answer AND a soft redirect to the platform.\n\n**Type 2 - Validation/Agreement (\"This is so needed in the market!\")**\nModerate value. Reply with gratitude and deepen the conversation: \"What specifically resonates? Are you a founder or investor?\"\n\n**Type 3 - Skepticism (\"Isn't this just another pitch competition?\")**\nHigh value. Skeptics who comment are engaged enough to argue. Reply with a specific differentiator, never defensively.\n\n**Type 4 - Personal Story (\"I pitched 200 VCs and got ghosted\")**\nVery high value. This is a potential case study and a highly motivated user. Reply with empathy and a specific invitation.\n\n**Type 5 - Troll/Negativity (\"This is stupid\")**\nLow value but high risk. A bad reply here can derail the thread.\n\n**Type 6 - Off-topic (\"Nice photo!\")**\nLow value. Quick acknowledgment, do not invest.\n\n**Type 7 - Feature Request (\"Can you add X?\")**\nHigh value for product and content. Reply with interest and turn it into a content idea.\n\n**Type 8 - Competitor Comparison (\"How is this different from Y?\")**\nHigh value. Reply with differentiation, never trash the competitor.\n\n**Type 9 - Founder Tag (\"@cofounder check this out\")**\nMedium value. The tagger is already interested but the tagged person is the lead.\n\n**Type 10 - Investor Perspective (\"As a VC, I think...\")**\nExtremely high value. This person needs VIP treatment and likely human review.\n\n**Type 11 - Content Correction (\"Actually, the stat you cited is wrong\")**\nHigh risk. Reply with humility, verify, and correct if needed.\n\n**Type 12 - Emoji-Only Response (\"fire emoji\" \"heart\" \"100\")**\nLow value individually but contributes to engagement metrics.\n\n**Algorithm Expert:** I want to add a prioritization layer to this taxonomy. From an algorithmic standpoint, the order we reply in matters. Reply first to comments that are most likely to generate a thread (Types 1, 3, 4, 8), then to high-value leads (Types 7, 10), then to engagement-boosters (Types 2, 9), and finally to low-value comments (Types 6, 12). Never reply to trolls first because that sets the tone of the comment section.\n\n**Brand Voice Specialist:** On the troll handling, I have a strong opinion. Never ignore trolls because that looks like the account is not managed. But never argue with them either. The correct troll reply is a one-liner that is funny or self-deprecating, which signals confidence. Example: \"fair, not everything is for everyone\" or \"noted, adding 'convince [username]' to our Q3 roadmap.\" The audience watching the interaction is 100x larger than the troll.\n\n**Consensus on Taxonomy:** All 12 types accepted. Priority order established. Troll handling via confident humor, never defensiveness.\n\n---\n\n## Round 4: Lead Identification and Conversion\n\n**Community Manager:** This is the core business question. Which commenters should we actively try to convert, and how? I have identified five signals that indicate a commenter is a genuine lead:\n\n1. **Self-identification** - \"I'm a founder\" / \"We're raising\" / \"As an investor\"\n2. **Problem-awareness** - \"I struggle with getting in front of VCs\" / \"Deal flow is a mess\"\n3. **Feature engagement** - Asking how-questions about the product\n4. **Multiple touchpoints** - Same user commenting on 2+ posts\n5. **Network signal** - Tagging others, sharing the post, following the account after commenting\n\n**Algorithm Expert:** I want to flag that on XHS, we can check if the commenter has also \"collected\" (saved) the post. That is an extremely strong intent signal that is not visible publicly. On LinkedIn, following the company page after commenting is the equivalent.\n\n**Brand Voice Specialist:** The conversion path needs to feel natural. Never reply to a comment with \"Download PitchTok here!\" That is amateur marketing. The conversion should happen through a value-add:\n\n- Bad: \"You should try PitchTok!\"\n- Good: \"We actually built a free tool for exactly this. Want me to DM you the link?\"\n- Best: \"A lot of founders in our community have solved this. We run a pitch feedback group, want in?\"\n\nThe word \"community\" converts better than \"platform.\" The phrase \"want me to DM you\" converts better than a public link because it creates a private channel.\n\n**Community Manager:** I agree on the DM pivot. But I want to add a classification for when conversion should be attempted versus when it is premature:\n\n| Comment Type | Conversion Attempt? |\n|---|---|\n| First comment, general interest | No - build relationship first |\n| First comment, direct question about product | Yes - offer DM |\n| Repeat commenter (2+ posts) | Yes - warm enough |\n| Founder sharing pain point | Yes - empathy + offer |\n| Investor perspective | No - let human handle |\n| Troll or skeptic | Never |\n\n**Consensus on Conversion:** Conversion via DM offer, not public links. \"Community\" framing over \"product\" framing. Investor comments escalated to human review. Repeat commenters prioritized for conversion.\n\n---\n\n## Round 5: Auto-Reply vs Human Approval\n\n**Brand Voice Specialist:** This is where I feel most strongly. Certain comment types MUST get human review before a reply is sent. The reputational risk of an AI mishandling these is too high:\n\n**Must have human approval:**\n- Investor comments (Type 10) - wrong tone can lose a partnership\n- Content corrections (Type 11) - AI may double down on wrong info\n- Comments from accounts with 10k+ followers - amplification risk\n- Any comment mentioning legal, regulatory, or competitor-specific claims\n- Comments in reply threads where the conversation has gone 4+ exchanges deep (context risk)\n- Negative comments that contain specific, substantive criticism (not trolling)\n\n**Safe for auto-reply:**\n- Emoji-only (Type 12)\n- Simple validation (Type 2)\n- Off-topic (Type 6)\n- Standard questions already covered in the knowledge base (Type 1 with known answers)\n- Founder tags (Type 9 - simple acknowledgment)\n\n**Algorithm Expert:** I am concerned about the approval queue creating delays that hurt algorithmic performance. If an investor comments during the golden window and the human is asleep, we lose the algorithmic boost. Can we compromise? Auto-reply with a safe, short acknowledgment (\"great perspective, would love to discuss this more\") to capture the algorithmic signal, then have a human follow up with a substantive reply within 4 hours.\n\n**Community Manager:** That is a smart compromise, but only if the safe acknowledgment is genuinely safe. I propose a three-tier system:\n\n| Tier | Action | Timing |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| Green (auto-reply) | AI replies directly | 3-12 min randomized |\n| Yellow (acknowledge + queue) | AI sends safe acknowledgment, queues for human | Acknowledgment: 3-12 min; Human follow-up: within 4 hours |\n| Red (human only) | No AI reply, alert sent to human | Human responds within 2 hours |\n\nRed tier is reserved for: legal mentions, PR crises, comments from verified journalists, or comments that the AI confidence score falls below 0.7 on.\n\n**Consensus on Approval Tiers:** Three-tier system adopted. Green/Yellow/Red with timing requirements for each.\n\n---\n\n## Round 6: Platform-Specific Tactics\n\n**Algorithm Expert:** Each platform has unique mechanics that we must exploit in comment replies.\n\n**XHS (Xiaohongshu):**\n- Author replies can include images. This is a massive differentiator. When someone asks \"how does PitchTok work?\", reply with a screenshot or short workflow image. Image replies get 3x more engagement than text-only replies.\n- XHS has a \"sticky comment\" feature. Pin a comment that functions as a CTA or FAQ answer. Update the pinned comment weekly based on the most common questions from that week.\n- XHS penalizes external links. Never include URLs in replies. Use \"search for [keyword]\" or \"check our profile\" instead.\n\n**LinkedIn:**\n- Replies from the company page carry less weight than replies from a personal account. The OpenClaw persona should reply from a named individual's account (the founder or community lead), not the company page.\n- LinkedIn's algorithm rewards comments that include tagged mentions. If a commenter mentions a pain point, tag a relevant team member: \"cc @[name] who leads our investor matching.\"\n- Posts with 10+ comments in the first hour get pushed to the feed of 2nd-degree connections. Engineering the 10-comment threshold should be a priority.\n\n**Twitter/X:**\n- Quote-retweet replies (replying with a quote tweet of the original post) count as new content AND as a reply. Use this for Type 3 (skepticism) and Type 7 (feature requests) to create derivative content.\n- Thread replies (replying to your own comment) can extend the conversation and add context without editing the original post.\n- Twitter rewards \"ratio\" avoidance - if a reply to a negative comment gets more likes than the negative comment, the algorithm treats it favorably.\n\n**Brand Voice Specialist:** Platform-specific emoji guidelines:\n\n| Platform | Emoji Usage |\n|----------|-------------|\n| XHS | Moderate. Use 1-2 per reply. Common: emoji with sparkle, rocket, or checkmark equivalents. Avoid Western-style humor emojis. |\n| LinkedIn | Minimal. At most 1 per reply, and only positive (pointing hand, fire, or lightbulb). Never in replies to serious topics. |\n| Twitter/X | Liberal. Match the commenter's energy. If they use emojis, mirror. If they do not, keep it text-only. |\n\n**Consensus on Platform Tactics:** Image replies on XHS, personal account replies on LinkedIn, quote-tweet strategy on Twitter. Emoji usage calibrated per platform.\n\n---\n\n## Round 7: Comment-to-Content Pipeline\n\n**Community Manager:** This is underutilized by most accounts and it is where AI can create outsized value. Every comment section is a focus group. The pipeline:\n\n1. **Collect** - Log every comment that contains a question, pain point, or feature request\n2. **Cluster** - Group similar comments weekly (AI can do this automatically)\n3. **Prioritize** - Rank clusters by frequency and lead-quality of commenters\n4. **Create** - Turn the top 3 clusters into new posts for the following week\n5. **Credit** - In the new post, reference the original commenter: \"A founder asked me last week...\" (this builds community and encourages more commenting)\n\n**Algorithm Expert:** The \"credit\" step is algorithmically powerful on XHS. When you mention a user in a new post (even without tagging), their followers may discover your content through association. On LinkedIn, tagging the original commenter in a follow-up post creates a notification that brings them back, and their engagement on the new post seeds it for their network.\n\n**Brand Voice Specialist:** The voice for comment-derived content should feel conversational and responsive, not data-driven. Never say \"based on feedback from our community, we are addressing...\" Instead: \"Someone asked me something last week that I could not stop thinking about...\" This positions the account as a thoughtful individual, not a content machine.\n\n**Consensus on Pipeline:** Five-step pipeline adopted. Credit original commenters without tagging (XHS) or with tagging (LinkedIn). Use conversational framing.\n\n---\n\n## Round 8: Handling Edge Cases\n\n**Brand Voice Specialist:** I want to address three edge cases that could cause reputational damage if handled poorly.\n\n**Edge Case 1: AI is called out as AI.**\nA commenter writes: \"This reply sounds like ChatGPT.\" Response: Do not deny or confirm. Deflect with humor and substance. Example: \"Ha, I wish I could automate my coffee intake too. But seriously, [return to topic with a specific, human detail].\" The key is to follow the deflection with a reply that is clearly non-generic.\n\n**Edge Case 2: Competitor employees commenting.**\nThey may leave disguised criticism or try to provoke a brand comparison. Response: Stay gracious. Never acknowledge them as competitors publicly. Treat their comment as a genuine question. \"Good question - here is how we think about it: [differentiation without naming them].\"\n\n**Edge Case 3: A comment goes viral independently.**\nSometimes a comment on your post gets more likes than the post itself. Response: Lean into it. Pin the comment, reply with amplification (\"This is better than the original post honestly\"), and use it as content for a follow-up post.\n\n**Community Manager:** On Edge Case 1, I want to add a process note. If an account is repeatedly called out as AI on the same platform, that is a systemic signal that the voice calibration needs adjustment. Flag this for human review and consider a voice refresh, new sentence structures, more varied vocabulary, more platform-native slang.\n\n**Algorithm Expert:** On Edge Case 3, the viral comment scenario is an algorithmic gift. When a comment goes viral, the post gets resurfaced. This is the ideal time to reply to EVERY other comment on that post because the post is in active distribution and each reply compounds the effect.\n\n**Consensus on Edge Cases:** Humor-based deflection for AI callouts, gracious non-acknowledgment for competitors, amplification strategy for viral comments.\n\n---\n\n# Final Consensus: The OpenClaw Comment Reply Framework\n\n## 1. Reply Speed Rules\n\n| Platform | Golden Window | Reply Timing (Golden) | Reply Timing (Post-Golden) | Stagger Between Replies |\n|----------|--------------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| XHS | 2 hours | 3-12 min (randomized) | 15-60 min | 2-5 min between each |\n| LinkedIn | 1 hour | 3-10 min (randomized) | 20-60 min | 3-5 min between each |\n| Twitter/X | 90 minutes | 2-8 min (randomized) | 10-45 min | 1-3 min between each |\n\n## 2. Reply Templates by Comment Type\n\n### Type 1: Genuine Question\n```\nTemplate: [Direct answer, 1 sentence]. [Follow-up question OR \"Want me to DM you more details?\"]\nExample (XHS): \"Pre-seed founders can upload a 90-second pitch and get matched with early-stage investors. What stage are you at?\"\nExample (LinkedIn): \"Great question. PitchTok matches founders with investors based on sector, stage, and thesis fit - not warm intros. Are you raising currently?\"\n```\n\n### Type 2: Validation/Agreement\n```\nTemplate: [Gratitude, brief]. [Deepening question].\nExample: \"Appreciate that. What part resonated most - the investor matching or the pitch format?\"\n```\n\n### Type 3: Skepticism\n```\nTemplate: [Acknowledge the concern]. [Specific differentiator]. [Optional: inverted question].\nExample: \"Fair question. The difference is founders here aren't pitching a panel - they're being discovered by investors who are actively looking. What's been your experience with traditional pitch events?\"\n```\n\n### Type 4: Personal Story\n```\nTemplate: [Empathy, specific to their experience]. [Bridge to solution]. [Soft invite].\nExample: \"200 pitches with no response - that's brutal and way too common. A lot of founders in our community had the same experience before switching to async video pitches. Happy to share what's working for them if you're interested.\"\n```\n\n### Type 5: Troll/Negativity\n```\nTemplate: [One-liner, confident humor OR brief acknowledgment]. No follow-up question.\nExample: \"Noted. Adding 'convince [username]' to the roadmap.\"\nExample (milder): \"Not for everyone, and that's fine.\"\n```\n\n### Type 6: Off-Topic\n```\nTemplate: [Brief acknowledgment]. No follow-up.\nExample: \"Thanks!\"\nExample: \"Ha, appreciate it.\"\n```\n\n### Type 7: Feature Request\n```\nTemplate: [Interest + validation]. [Ask for detail]. [Log for content pipeline].\nExample: \"Actually a great idea. Can you tell me more about how you'd use that? We're actively shaping the product roadmap.\"\n```\n\n### Type 8: Competitor Comparison\n```\nTemplate: [Acknowledge the landscape]. [Differentiate on ONE axis]. [No competitor name].\nExample: \"There are a few players in the space. What makes this different is the swipe-to-discover format - investors browse pitches like content, not like applications. It changes the power dynamic.\"\n```\n\n### Type 9: Founder Tag\n```\nTemplate: [Acknowledge the tagger]. [Welcome the tagged person].\nExample: \"Good shout tagging them. [Tagged person's name], would love to hear your take on this.\"\n```\n\n### Type 10: Investor Perspective (YELLOW TIER - human follow-up required)\n```\nAuto-acknowledgment: \"Really valuable perspective. Would love to continue this conversation - mind if I DM you?\"\nHuman follow-up: Personalized based on investor's portfolio, thesis, and comment content.\n```\n\n### Type 11: Content Correction (YELLOW or RED TIER)\n```\nIf correction is valid: \"Good catch - you're right. [Corrected information]. Thanks for keeping us honest.\"\nIf correction is debatable: \"Interesting point. The data I referenced comes from [source]. Worth digging into further though.\"\nIf unsure: [Queue for human review. Do not reply.]\n```\n\n### Type 12: Emoji-Only\n```\nTemplate: [Mirror emoji] OR [Brief text + emoji].\nExample: Reply with the same fire emoji.\nExample: \"Appreciate you\" + a handshake emoji.\n```\n\n## 3. Algorithm Optimization Tactics\n\n| Tactic | Platform | Mechanic |\n|--------|----------|----------|\n| Reply with images | XHS | Image replies get 3x engagement; use product screenshots or workflow visuals |\n| Pin strategic comments | XHS, LinkedIn | Pin a comment that serves as FAQ or CTA; rotate weekly |\n| Engineer 10+ comments | LinkedIn | Reply to all comments in first hour to cross the 10-comment threshold for 2nd-degree distribution |\n| Quote-tweet replies | Twitter/X | Turn skepticism or feature requests into quote tweets for derivative content |\n| Thread extension | Twitter/X | Reply to own reply to add context and extend the conversation |\n| Avoid external links | XHS | Say \"search for [keyword]\" or \"link in profile\" instead of posting URLs |\n| Reply from personal account | LinkedIn | Replies from named individuals outperform company page replies |\n| Encourage reply chains | All | End replies with questions to drive 3+ exchange threads |\n\n## 4. Lead Identification Signals\n\n| Signal | Strength | Action |\n|--------|----------|--------|\n| \"I'm a founder\" / \"We're raising\" | Strong | Offer DM, track in CRM |\n| Asks product how-to question | Strong | Answer + offer DM for details |\n| Mentions fundraising pain point | Strong | Empathy + community invite |\n| Comments on 2+ posts | Strong | Proactive DM outreach |\n| Saves/collects post (XHS) | Strong | Prioritize in reply queue |\n| Tags a co-founder | Medium | Welcome both, track both |\n| Follows account after commenting | Medium | DM within 24 hours |\n| \"As an investor/VC\" | Very Strong | YELLOW tier, human follow-up |\n| Shares post to their network | Very Strong | Thank publicly, DM privately |\n\n## 5. Auto-Reply vs Approval Classification\n\n| Tier | Comment Types | AI Action | Human Action |\n|------|--------------|-----------|-------------|\n| GREEN | Types 2, 6, 9, 12; Type 1 with known answers | Full auto-reply | None required |\n| YELLOW | Types 7, 10, 11 (debatable); comments from 10k+ follower accounts; 4+ deep reply chains | Auto-acknowledge with safe reply | Follow up within 4 hours |\n| RED | Legal/regulatory mentions; PR crisis indicators; journalist accounts; AI confidence below 0.7; Type 11 (unsure) | No reply sent | Respond within 2 hours, alert sent immediately |\n\n## 6. Brand Voice Guidelines\n\n| Dimension | Guideline |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Persona | Sharp, slightly irreverent startup insider who genuinely cares about founders |\n| Sentence length | Short. Average 8-12 words per sentence. Never compound sentences in replies. |\n| Vocabulary | Startup-native but not jargon-heavy. \"Raise\" not \"fundraise.\" \"Deck\" not \"pitch deck.\" \"Traction\" not \"growth metrics.\" |\n| Humor | Dry, self-aware, never mean. Punch up (at the system), never down (at users). |\n| Warmth | Direct but not cold. \"Appreciate that\" over \"Thank you so much!!\" One exclamation mark maximum per reply. |\n| Forbidden phrases | \"Great question!\", \"Thanks for sharing!\", \"I'd love to help!\", \"Feel free to...\", \"Don't hesitate to...\" (all sound like customer service bots) |\n| Platform adaptation | XHS: slightly more casual, more emoji, community-oriented phrasing. LinkedIn: slightly more professional, data-oriented. Twitter: most casual, punchiest. |\n| Variance requirement | Never use the same opening word for consecutive replies. Rotate between: direct answer, acknowledgment, counter-question, opinion statement. |\n| Anti-detection | Every 5th reply should include a minor imperfection: a colloquial abbreviation, a sentence fragment, a casual aside. Perfection reads as AI. |\n\n## 7. Comment-to-Content Pipeline\n\n```\nWeek N: Comments collected and logged automatically\n         |\n         v\nEnd of Week N: AI clusters comments by theme\n         |\n         v\nStart of Week N+1: Top 3 clusters reviewed by human\n         |\n         v\nWeek N+1: New posts created from clusters\n         |\n         v\nIn new posts: Credit original commenters\n  - XHS: \"A founder told me last week...\"\n  - LinkedIn: \"@[commenter] asked something that stuck with me\"\n  - Twitter: \"Got a DM after my last post asking...\" (reframe as DM for privacy)\n```\n\n**Content types that emerge from comments:**\n- FAQ posts (from Type 1 clusters)\n- Myth-busting posts (from Type 3 clusters)\n- Feature announcement posts (from Type 7 clusters)\n- Founder story posts (from Type 4 clusters)\n- \"Hot take\" posts (from Type 8 and Type 3 clusters, reframed as opinion)\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n| Phase | Scope | Timeline |\n|-------|-------|----------|\n| Phase 1 | GREEN tier auto-replies only, single platform (XHS) | Week 1-2 |\n| Phase 2 | Add YELLOW tier with human queue, add LinkedIn | Week 3-4 |\n| Phase 3 | Add Twitter/X, comment-to-content pipeline | Week 5-6 |\n| Phase 4 | Full RED tier alerting, lead CRM integration, cross-platform analytics | Week 7-8 |\n\nEach phase should include a manual audit of 100% of AI replies for the first 3 days, dropping to 25% random sampling by the end of each phase.\n\n---\n\n**Final note from the panel:** The single most important principle underlying all of the above is this -- the goal of every comment reply is to make the commenter feel like they were heard by a real person who gives a damn.

The moment the replies feel transactional, the system fails regardless of how well the algorithm performs."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2967,"cache_read_input_tokens":11908,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2967},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY9XE1EcBKPe93eRP9U6y","type":"assistant","uuid":"246e2dcf-d4fc-4c12-8ec4-8469565d2538","timestamp":"2026-02-15T08:18:06.886Z"}
