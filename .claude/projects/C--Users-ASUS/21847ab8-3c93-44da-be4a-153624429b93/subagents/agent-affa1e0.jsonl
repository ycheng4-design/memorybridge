Do not post anything promotional.\n\n2. **Week 3-4: Add value.** Answer questions about fundraising, pitch strategy, investor relations. Share genuine expertise. Become a recognized helpful member.\n\n3. **Week 5+: Soft mentions.** When someone asks \"how do I get in front of investors?\" or \"should I do a pitch deck?\" -- then organically mention PitchTok as one option among several.\n\n**Per-Community Tactics:**\n\n**Indie Hackers:**\n- Comment on milestone posts with genuine congratulations and follow-up questions\n- Write a detailed post: \"I analyzed 500 startup pitches: here is what works\" (include PitchTok data naturally)\n- Engage in \"What are you working on?\" threads\n\n**Reddit (r/startups, r/SaaS):**\n- Answer questions in comments thoroughly\n- Never post a link to PitchTok in the first month\n- After establishing karma, create a \"resource list for fundraising\" post that includes PitchTok alongside other tools\n- Use a personal account, not a branded one\n\n**Hacker News:**\n- Comment on Show HN posts with thoughtful technical feedback\n- When relevant, share as \"Show HN: PitchTok\" with genuine technical story\n- Engage with commenters personally\n\n---\n\n## 4.

COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS\n\n### CAN-SPAM Act Requirements (US Email)\n\n**Mandatory for every commercial email:**\n\n1. **Accurate header information:** \"From\" name and email must be real\n2. **No deceptive subject lines:** Subject must relate to email content\n3. **Identify as advertisement:** If purely promotional, must be labeled (note: B2B outreach with genuine relevance often qualifies as relationship-building, but err on the side of caution)\n4. **Physical address:** Every email must include a valid physical mailing address\n5. **Opt-out mechanism:** Every email must include a clear unsubscribe link\n6. **Honor opt-outs within 10 business days:** Instantly.ai handles this automatically\n7. **Monitor third parties:** You are responsible for emails sent on your behalf\n\n**Implementation:**\n```\nFooter for every email:\n---\nPitchTok Inc. | 123 Main Street, San Francisco, CA 94105\nUnsubscribe: {unsubscribe_link}\n```\n\n### LinkedIn Terms of Service Boundaries\n\n**Allowed:**\n- Sending connection requests with personalized notes\n- Sending InMail to non-connections (with Sales Navigator)\n- Posting content on company page and personal profiles\n- Engaging with posts via comments and reactions\n\n**Not Allowed (will result in account restriction):**\n- Sending more than 100 connection requests per week (safe limit: 80-100)\n- Using automation tools that violate LinkedIn ToS (Dripify and Phantom Buster operate in a gray area; use at your own risk with conservative limits)\n- Scraping LinkedIn data for use outside the platform\n- Sending identical messages to large numbers of people\n- Creating fake profiles or misrepresenting identity\n\n**Safe Limits:**\n- Connection requests: Max 25/day, 100/week\n- InMails: Max 50/month (Sales Navigator allocation)\n- Profile views: Max 150/day\n- Messages to connections: Max 50/day\n\n### GDPR Considerations (International Founders)\n\nEven though primary target is US-based, you may encounter EU/UK citizens:\n\n1. **Legitimate interest basis:** B2B outreach to founders about a relevant platform can be justified under legitimate interest, but you must:\n   - Only contact people whose public profile indicates relevance\n   - Provide easy opt-out in every communication\n   - Delete data upon request within 30 days\n   - Not purchase email lists from third parties without consent verification\n\n2. **Data storage:**\n   - Store only necessary data (name, email, company, stage)\n   - Document your legal basis for processing\n   - Have a privacy policy that covers outreach activities\n\n3. **Right to be forgotten:**\n   - Honor all deletion requests\n   - Remove from all systems including email tools, CRM, spreadsheets\n\n### What NOT To Do\n\n1. **Never buy email lists.** Always source emails from public profiles, company websites, or tools like Apollo/Hunter that scrape public data.\n\n2. **Never send more than 50 emails/day per domain.** Deliverability will tank.\n\n3. **Never lie about who you are or what PitchTok does.** No fake scarcity (\"only 10 spots left\"), no misleading claims (\"guaranteed funding\").\n\n4. **Never spam communities.** One promotional post in a community that bans self-promotion will get you permanently banned and damage brand reputation.\n\n5. **Never scrape or store data without a clear legitimate purpose.** Every piece of data you collect should have a reason tied to outreach.\n\n6. **Never send emails on weekends or late at night.** It signals automation and reduces trust.\n\n7. **Never use someone's personal email for B2B outreach.** Always use work/startup email addresses.\n\n8. **Never follow up more than 4 times.** After 4 touches with no response, the lead is dead. Move on.\n\n9. **Never publicly post screenshots of private conversations** without explicit permission.\n\n10. **Never make promises about fundraising outcomes.** PitchTok provides visibility, not guaranteed funding. Any claim otherwise could have legal implications under securities regulations.\n\n### Securities Law Awareness\n\nSince PitchTok operates at the intersection of founders and investors:\n\n- Do not act as a broker-dealer (do not facilitate actual transactions)\n- Do not guarantee investment outcomes\n- Do not charge founders a percentage of funds raised (this could trigger broker-dealer registration)\n- Consult a securities attorney about your business model if you have not already\n- Ensure investor verification on the platform (accredited investor status under Reg D)\n\n---\n\n## APPENDIX: TOOL STACK SUMMARY\n\n| Function | Tool | Monthly Cost |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n| Email finding | Apollo.io | $49 |\n| Email sending | Instantly.ai | $30 |\n| LinkedIn automation | Dripify | $59 |\n| LinkedIn intelligence | Sales Navigator | $99 |\n| CRM | HubSpot Free or Notion | $0 |\n| Analytics | Google Sheets + Retool | $0-50 |\n| Link tracking | UTM builder + Google Analytics | $0 |\n| Content scheduling | Buffer or Typefully | $15 |\n| Xiaohongshu management | Native app | $0 |\n| Domain warm-up | Included in Instantly.ai | $0 |\n| **Total** | | **~$300/mo** |\n\n---\n\n## APPENDIX: QUICK-START CHECKLIST (First 14 Days)\n\n- [ ] Day 1-2: Set up 3 email domains, begin warm-up in Instantly.ai\n- [ ] Day 1-2: Set up LinkedIn Sales Navigator, build saved searches\n- [ ] Day 3-4: Source first 500 leads from AngelList + Product Hunt + Twitter\n- [ ] Day 3-4: Score leads, segment into Hot/Warm/Cool\n- [ ] Day 5-7: Write email sequences, set up in Instantly.ai (do not send yet, domains warming)\n- [ ] Day 5-7: Begin LinkedIn connection requests (manual, 15/day)\n- [ ] Day 7-10: Join 5 communities (Slack + Discord + Reddit), begin observing\n- [ ] Day 10-12: Set up Xiaohongshu account, post first 3 pieces of content\n- [ ] Day 14: Domains warmed, launch first email campaign (Experiment 1)\n- [ ] Day 14: First weekly review, set Month 1 targets\n\n---\n\nThis playbook is designed to be a living document.
