It allows people to perform tasks such as scheduling, organising files, and writing code without relying on separate chat apps.\n\nOpenClaw bots run locally and are designed to integrate with an external large language model such as Claude, DeepSeek, or one of OpenAI's GPT models, with functionality accessed via a chatbot within messaging services like Signal, Telegram, Discord, or WhatsApp.\n\n## Key Capabilities\n\nUnlike traditional chatbots, OpenClaw runs on a user's own infrastructure and autonomously executes real tasks, managing email, browsing the web, booking flights, and more. Users can expand the tool's capabilities using over 100 preconfigured AgentSkills that allow the AI to execute shell commands, manage file systems, and perform web automation.\n\n## Important Security Considerations\n\nOpenClaw's design has drawn scrutiny from cybersecurity researchers due to the broad permissions it requires to function effectively, as the software can access email accounts, calendars, messaging platforms, and other sensitive services, presenting security and privacy risks.
