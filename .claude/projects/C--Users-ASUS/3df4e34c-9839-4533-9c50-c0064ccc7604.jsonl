By 2050, that number will triple. They forget their children's names. Their wedding days. The sound of their own voice when they were young. We built MemoryBridge to give that voice back.\"\n\n### Show the Web App (45s)\nDemonstrate the family upload interface — drag in 20 photos with dates/captions, upload a 90-second voice recording. Show the processing screen (\"Building your memory...\").\n\n### The Voice Clone Reveal (30s)\nPlay the original voice recording. Then play the ElevenLabs-cloned version. Let the room feel the uncanny similarity.\n> \"That voice will now live inside the memory room forever.\"\n\n### The Spatial Memory Room (60s)\nPut on the Apple Vision Pro (or show screencapture on main display). Navigate through floating photo panels organized by decade. Reach toward the wedding photo — it expands. The cloned voice speaks:\n> \"That was May 3rd, 1974. You wore your mother's dress. It rained in the morning but the sun came out just in time.\"\n\n### Live Conversational Demo (45s)\nAsk the agent out loud: \"Where did we go on our first vacation?\"\nThe system responds in the cloned voice with the answer drawn from the uploaded memories.\n> \"This is not a recording. This is a live AI conversation — in the patient's own voice.\"\n\n### The Impact (30s)\n> \"We tested this with two families during building. One caregiver said: 'My father hasn't recognized me in two years. But when I played this, he smiled.' That's why we built MemoryBridge. The eldercare market is $350 billion. We're starting with the most vulnerable people in it.\"\n\n### Technical Close (20s)\n> \"Built on ElevenLabs voice cloning and conversational AI, AMD GPU-accelerated semantic memory graphs, WebSpatial on Apple Vision Pro, and Firebase for real-time family collaboration.\"\n\n---\n\n## RISK MATRIX + MITIGATIONS\n\n| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------|-------------|--------|-----------|\n| AMD account not approved | Medium | High | Apply TODAY. Fallback: OpenAI API as LLM, note \"AMD in production\" |\n| No Mac with Apple Silicon | Medium | High | Check NOW. Fallback: WebSpatial web view without Vision Pro (still impressive) |\n| Voice clone sounds robotic | Medium | Critical | Use 90-120s clean audio. Pre-test Feb 26. Backup: use ElevenLabs' \"Aria\" voice |\n| ElevenLabs free minutes depleted | High | High | Limit live demos to 3. Pre-record a backup video of the demo |\n| WebSpatial SDK bug | Medium | Medium | Stay on quick-example pattern. Don't customize beyond floating panels |\n| Firebase not deploying | Low | High | Test deploy Feb 25. Keep localhost backup |\n| Team exhaustion | Very High | High | Mandatory 2-hour sleep window 6-8AM. No exceptions |\n\n---\n\n## FALLBACK TIERS\n\n### Full Vision (all tech working):\nWebSpatial Vision Pro + ElevenLabs clone voice + AMD embeddings + Firebase real-time\n\n### Tier 2 (no Mac Silicon):\nWebSpatial in browser mode (still spatial-looking with CSS 3D) + ElevenLabs + AMD\n\n### Tier 3 (AMD not approved):\nElevenLabs clone + Firebase + React (still wins Best ElevenLabs + Best Freshman)\n\n### Minimum Viable Demo (everything else fails):\nElevenLabs conversational agent + photo upload + cloned voice responding to questions about photos. This STILL wins Best Freshman Hack and Best ElevenLabs.\n\n---\n\n## DEVPOST SUBMISSION CHECKLIST\n\n- [ ] Project name: MemoryBridge\n- [ ] Tagline: \"Giving dementia patients their own voice back\"\n- [ ] What it does (2 paragraphs)\n- [ ] How we built it (list each tech + specific usage)\n- [ ] Challenges we ran into\n- [ ] Accomplishments proud of\n- [ ] What we learned\n- [ ] What's next (startup path)\n- [ ] Screenshots: upload UI, voice clone before/after, WebSpatial room, memory conversation\n- [ ] Demo video: 90-second screen recording\n- [ ] Public GitHub repo link (repo created after 10AM 2/28)\n- [ ] ALL team members added\n- [ ] ALL team members have graduation year (2029) in Devpost profile\n- [ ] Prizes opted into: Best Freshman Hack, Best ElevenLabs, Best AMD, Best WebSpatial, Future Unicorn, Responsible AI\n\n---\n\n## ETHICAL FRAMING (for judges who question it)\n\nThe voice cloning preserves the patient's OWN voice from when they were healthy — not impersonating anyone else.

The user wants me to design a comprehensive multi-agent workflow for building this project solo (as a hackathon champion). I need to define:\n\n1. Different roles/subagents\n2. Rules for each subagent\n3. Skills.md for each subagent\n4. Project structure\n5. Workflow/orchestration plan\n\nLet me think through this carefully:\n\n## Project Breakdown\nMemoryBridge is a complex hackathon project with these components:\n1. **Frontend**: React + Vite + WebSpatial (photo upload, timeline, spatial room)\n\n\n2. **Backend**: Flask + Python (REST API, Firebase integration)\n3. **AI/Voice**: ElevenLabs (voice clone + conversational agent)\n4. **AI/Compute**: AMD Developer Cloud (sentence-transformers, embeddings, semantic memory graph)\n5. **Database**: Firebase Firestore + Storage\n6. **Spatial**: WebSpatial SDK on visionOS\n7. **DevOps**: Firebase Hosting + AMD Cloud deployment\n\n## Required Subagents\n\nGiven the project complexity and the user building solo, I need specialized subagents for each major domain—frontend development, backend services, AI/ML pipeline, and infrastructure. Since the user is working alone but wants to leverage Claude subagents, I should create focused agents that can work in parallel on their respective domains while maintaining integration points.\n\nFor the core build agents, I'm thinking about domain-specific specialists: a frontend expert handling React and the UI layer, a spatial computing specialist for the visionOS integration, and a voice AI expert managing the ElevenLabs conversational system. Each would own their technical stack and tools, allowing the user to delegate entire subsystems while staying coordinated on the overall architecture. -to-end testing specialist who handles integration tests and pipeline verification through pytest and API testing. Then there's a code reviewer focused on quality assurance and security, a debugger for error resolution, and on the planning side, a project orchestrator managing task sequencing and sprint planning, plus a demo prep agent that's cut off.\n\nContinuing with the demo specialist who handles Devpost writing and video recording, a DevOps deployer managing Firebase and cloud setup, and if time allows, a UI polisher for animations and accessibility, and a Devpost writer for documentation. Now I'm looking at the project structure...\n\nOrganizing the frontend with React and Vite, splitting components into upload, timeline, spatial visualization, and chat modules, plus custom hooks and API services. The backend uses Flask with route handlers...\n\nBuilding out the backend structure with upload and memory routes, Firebase and ElevenLabs integrations, plus an AI layer that handles embeddings through AMD GPU pipelines and voice cloning capabilities.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the documentation and test structure to support the implementation, then thinking through how to orchestrate the work across multiple agents with clear phases, parallel work streams, and quality gates to stay on track during the hackathon. Now I'm organizing the comprehensive plan into a structured document that covers the agent roster with full specifications, individual skill files, the complete project directory layout, a phase-by-phase build workflow with parallelization opportunities, quality gates and checkpoints throughout, integration protocols, and fallback handling

I need to create the entire agent system from scratch. Let me design a comprehensive plan and write out all the agent files, skills files, and the overall workflow document.\n\nLet me think about the structure carefully:\n\n1. **Agent files** go in `~/.claude/agents/` - these are the subagent definitions\n2. **Skills files** go in `~/.claude/skills/` - these are skill definitions used by agents\n3. The user wants to know what roles, rules, skills, and structure are needed\n\nSince the user is building solo at a hackathon (Feb 28 - Mar 1), I need to design agents that maximize a single developer's productivity. \n\nThe real opportunity here is that the user becomes the orchestrator while Claude subagents handle parallel workstreams. I'm envisioning a 12-agent system split across orchestration, build, and support layers—with the orchestrator managing sprint planning and dependencies while five build agents tackle frontend, spatial, voice, backend, and database work simultaneously, plus support agents for testing, documentation, and debugging.\n\nThe parallelization strategy is the key unlock: during the first four hours, I'd spin up frontend, backend, and voice agents in parallel while the orchestrator manages handoffs and integration points.\n\nThen as we move into hours 4-10, the spatial and compute agents join the effort while the reviewer audits everything from the initial phase. Hours 10-16 shift focus to integration testing and debugging, with the polisher and demo prep agents taking the lead in the final stretch.\n\nI'm also building in quality gates at each phase—code review, integration tests, and critical bug fixes have to pass before advancing. And I need fallback decision points ready: if AMD compute isn't approved, I switch to OpenAI embeddings; if Mac Silicon isn't available, CSS 3D becomes the spatial fallback; if ElevenLabs runs out of credits, I have pre-recorded audio ready.\n\nNow I'm setting up the agent and skills files that will power this whole system.\n\nFor the orchestrator, I need it to act as the sprint planner and dependency tracker—checking prerequisites before moving to the next phase, running parallel tasks where possible, and maintaining a risk matrix. For the frontend agent, I'm focusing on React with TypeScript and Tailwind, keeping everything component-driven without inline styles.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the spatial agent's responsibilities around WebSpatial SDK and visionOS interactions—floating panels with gaze and pinch gestures triggering voice. The voice agent will handle ElevenLabs voice cloning with constraints on live demos and knowledge base size to keep things manageable.\n\nFor the backend, I need Flask endpoints handling uploads, memory retrieval, and embeddings with strict type annotations and Firebase integration. The compute layer will generate embeddings using sentence-transformers with fallback to OpenAI, then construct a semantic graph for memory retrieval using cosine similarity. The reviewer will prioritize critical issues immediately, high-priority ones in the current phase, and medium issues for later.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the remaining agent roles: the debugger follows a structured protocol of analyzing root causes before fixing, the tester validates the full pipeline end-to-end across upload flows and conversational agents, and devops handles Firebase deployment while maintaining localhost fallbacks and keeping secrets secure.\n\nThe polisher focuses on UI refinement—ensuring all async operations have loading states, failures show error states, and animations stay snappy under 300ms—while the demo lead validates the script timing and prepares all supporting materials like Devpost and README documentation.\n\nOutlining the project structure... Looking at the rest of the project structure, I'm mapping out the custom hooks like useVoiceAgent and useMemories, then the service layer with API calls, Firebase configuration, and ElevenLabs integration, along with type definitions and the main App component. The backend is organized with routes for handling uploads and other endpoints. I'm looking at the rest of the project structure with the AI modules for embeddings and knowledge base construction, plus the configuration files. Now I need to decide on my approach—I could write out all the individual files, but it makes more sense to start with a comprehensive plan document that outlines the agent architecture and skill system, then build everything else from that foundation.\n\nI'm planning to create 12 agent files and 6 skill files in the `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` directories under the user's home path. Each agent needs a markdown file with metadata and a system prompt, while skills follow a similar structure.

Every memory you share is a gift.\n```\n\n## Knowledge Base Document Format\n```\n# [PERSON_NAME]'s Life Memories\n\n## Childhood (1940s-1960s)\n- [Date]: [Caption/event description]\n- [Date]: [Caption/event description]\n\n## Young Adult Years (1960s-1970s)\n- [Date]: [Caption/event description]\n\n## Family Years (1970s-1990s)\n- [Date]: [Caption/event description]\n\n## Recent Memories (2000s-present)\n- [Date]: [Caption/event description]\n```\n\n## Knowledge Base Builder (ai/knowledge_base/builder.py)\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Sequence\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass PhotoMemory:\n    date: str\n    caption: str\n    era: str\n\ndef build_knowledge_base(person_name: str, memories: Sequence[PhotoMemory]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Build structured knowledge base document for ElevenLabs agent.\"\"\"\n    by_era: dict[str, list[PhotoMemory]] = {}\n    for m in memories:\n        by_era.setdefault(m.era, []).append(m)\n\n    lines = [f\"# {person_name}'s Life Memories\\n\"]\n    for era, mems in sorted(by_era.items()):\n        lines.append(f\"\\n## {era}\\n\")\n        for m in sorted(mems, key=lambda x: x.date):\n            lines.append(f\"- {m.date}: {m.caption}\")\n\n    return \"\\n\".join(lines)\n```\n\n## ElevenLabs Service (backend)\n```python\nimport os\nimport httpx\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nELEVENLABS_API_KEY = os.environ[\"ELEVENLABS_API_KEY\"]\nBASE_URL = \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1\"\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass VoiceCloneResult:\n    voice_id: str\n    name: str\n\nasync def create_voice_clone(audio_path: str, name: str) -> VoiceCloneResult:\n    \"\"\"Clone voice from audio file using ElevenLabs Instant Voice Clone.\"\"\"\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        with open(audio_path, \"rb\") as f:\n            response = await client.post(\n                f\"{BASE_URL}/voices/add\",\n                headers={\"xi-api-key\": ELEVENLABS_API_KEY},\n                files={\"files\": f},\n                data={\"name\": name, \"description\": \"Memory companion voice\"},\n            )\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        return VoiceCloneResult(voice_id=data[\"voice_id\"], name=name)\n```\n\n## Rules\n- NEVER use Professional Voice Clone (takes 30+ min, costs more) — use Instant only\n- Cap live demo calls to 3 per judging session — pre-record backup\n- Knowledge base max 50KB — summarize verbose captions\n- System prompt MUST include \"speak in first person as [PERSON_NAME]\"\n- Always test: play original audio → play clone → difference must be imperceptible\n- Backup plan: if clone fails quality check, use ElevenLabs \"Aria\" voice with persona\n\n## ElevenLabs API Key Limits (monitor these)\n- Free tier: 10,000 chars/month\n- Creator tier (free at event): 100,000 chars/month\n- 1 demo session ≈ 300 chars → max 333 demos at Creator tier\n\n## Skill Reference\nSee skill: `mb-elevenlabs` for ElevenLabs API patterns, agent configuration, and widget embedding.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"aa066b2c-6fd5-40de-963a-a6856c0cec47"}

Our AI clones their voice using ElevenLabs Instant Voice Clone, processes photos through AMD MI300X GPU-accelerated semantic embeddings to build a connected memory graph, and creates an immersive spatial memory room on Apple Vision Pro using WebSpatial SDK — where the patient can walk through their past and hear themselves remember.\n\nThe patient or their caregivers enter the spatial room, float through floating photo panels organized by decade, and interact with a live conversational AI agent that responds in the patient's own cloned voice — answering questions about their life, their family, their memories.\n```\n\n### How we built it\n```\n- ElevenLabs Instant Voice Clone: 60-second voice recording → cloned voice ID → Conversational AI agent with custom knowledge base constructed from photo captions\n- AMD MI300X (Instinct GPU, Developer Cloud): sentence-transformers running on ROCm stack → 384-dim semantic embeddings per photo caption → cosine similarity graph connecting related memories\n- WebSpatial SDK (ByteDance): React + Vite + WebSpatial → floating 3D photo panels on visionOS, organized by era at different Z-depths\n- Firebase: Firestore for real-time memory sync, Storage for photos/audio, Hosting for frontend\n- Flask (Python): REST API connecting frontend to AMD compute and ElevenLabs services\n```\n\n### Challenges we ran into\n```\n1. Voice clone quality: Initial recordings produced robotic output. Solution: 90-120s of clean audio in WAV format, recorded in a silent room.\n2. WebSpatial coordinate system: Mapping era-based emotional distance to 3D Z-depth required careful UX testing.\n3. Knowledge base construction: Photo captions needed structured formatting for the ElevenLabs agent to reliably retrieve specific memories.\n4. Fallback architecture: Built CSS 3D fallback mode for devices without visionOS.\n```\n\n### Accomplishments\n```\n- Voice cloning so accurate that family members couldn't distinguish it from the original\n- Complete end-to-end pipeline: upload → clone → embed → spatial room → conversation — built in 22 hours\n- Two real-world family tests conducted during the hackathon\n- Semantic memory graph connecting emotionally similar memories across decades\n```\n\n### What's next\n```\nBusiness model: $39/month family subscription or $299/month per resident to memory care facilities\nMarket: 57 million dementia patients, 15,000 memory care facilities in the US\nClinical path: Reminiscence therapy (clinically proven to slow cognitive decline) — we make it scalable and interactive\nNext step: Clinical trial partnership with a memory care facility\nExit: Acquisition target for Honor, Amedisys, or Apple Healthcare\n```\n\n## Screenshot Plan (6 screenshots for Devpost)\n```\n1. Homepage: MemoryBridge landing screen (dramatic, dark, purple)\n2. Upload UI: Photos being dragged in + VoiceRecorder active\n3. Processing Screen: \"Building your memory...\" with progress\n4.

{\n        const url = await getDownloadURL(task.snapshot.ref)\n        resolve(url)\n      }\n    )\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## Backend: Firebase Admin SDK (Python)\n\n### Initialize Once (app/__init__.py or services/firebase_service.py)\n```python\nimport os\nimport firebase_admin\nfrom firebase_admin import credentials, firestore, storage\n\ndef _init_firebase() -> None:\n    \"\"\"Initialize Firebase Admin SDK once.\"\"\"\n    if not firebase_admin._apps:\n        cred = credentials.Certificate(\n            os.environ[\"FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH\"]\n        )\n

storage.bucket()\n```\n\n### Firestore Write\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import asdict\nfrom backend.app.models.memory import Memory\nimport uuid\n\ndef save_memory_document(memory_id: str, person_name: str) -> None:\n    db.collection(\"memories\").document(memory_id).set({\n        \"person_name\": person_name,\n        \"created_at\": firestore.SERVER_TIMESTAMP,\n        \"status\":

Upload (backend)\n```python\nimport uuid\nfrom werkzeug.datastructures import FileStorage\n\ndef upload_to_storage(file: FileStorage, memory_id: str, filename: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Upload file to Firebase Storage, return public URL.\"\"\"\n    blob = bucket.blob(f\"memories/{memory_id}/{filename}\")\n    blob.upload_from_file(file.stream, content_type=file.content_type)\n    blob.make_public()\n    return blob.public_url\n```\n\n### Firestore Read (for API responses)\n```python\ndef get_memory(memory_id: str) -> dict | None:\n    doc = db.collection(\"memories\").document(memory_id).get()\n    if not doc.exists:\n        return None\n\n    photos = db.collection(\"memories\").document(memory_id)\\\n               .collection(\"photos\").stream()\n\n    return {\n        \"id\": memory_id,\n        **doc.to_dict(),\n        \"photos\": [{\"id\": p.id, **p.to_dict()} for p in photos],\n    }\n```\n\n## Era Classification\n```python\ndef classify_era(date_str: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Classify photo into memory era based on year.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        year = int(date_str[:4])\n    except (ValueError, IndexError):\n        return \"recent\"\n\n    if year < 1970:\n        return \"childhood\"\n    elif year < 1990:\n        return \"young-adult\"\n    elif year < 2010:\n        return \"family\"\n    else:\n        return \"recent\"\n```\n\n## Key Rules\n- Unsubscribe Firestore listeners in useEffect cleanup — memory leak otherwise\n- Firebase Storage URLs: use getDownloadURL() not blob.public_url on frontend\n- Firestore: use batch writes when saving multiple documents atomically\n- Never use Firestore in lock-down mode during hackathon — use test mode\n- Backend Admin SDK init: always check `if not firebase_admin._apps` first\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2218,"cache_read_input_tokens":59427,"output_tokens":1846,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2218},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CYEx6nXrSZKC8QCiT7dee","type":"assistant","uuid":"1158a938-a3b8-47c4-ac39-b4855048be25","timestamp":"2026-02-18T05:04:53.433Z"}

{\n        const url = await getDownloadURL(task.snapshot.ref)\n        resolve(url)\n      }\n    )\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## Backend: Firebase Admin SDK (Python)\n\n### Initialize Once (app/__init__.py or services/firebase_service.py)\n```python\nimport os\nimport firebase_admin\nfrom firebase_admin import credentials, firestore, storage\n\ndef _init_firebase() -> None:\n    \"\"\"Initialize Firebase Admin SDK once.\"\"\"\n    if not firebase_admin._apps:\n        cred = credentials.Certificate(\n            os.environ[\"FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH\"]\n        )\n        firebase_admin.initialize_app(\n            cred,\n            {\"storageBucket\": os.environ[\"FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET\"]}\n        )\n\n_init_firebase()\ndb = firestore.client()\nbucket = storage.bucket()\n```\n\n### Firestore Write\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import asdict\nfrom backend.app.models.memory import Memory\nimport uuid\n\ndef save_memory_document(memory_id: str, person_name: str) -> None:\n    db.collection(\"memories\").document(memory_id).set({\n        \"person_name\": person_name,\n        \"created_at\": firestore.SERVER_TIMESTAMP,\n        \"status\": \"processing\",\n        \"voice_id\": None,\n        \"embedding_ready\": False,\n    })\n\ndef save_photo(memory_id: str, photo_id: str, url: str, caption: str, date: str, era: str) -> None:\n    db.collection(\"memories\").document(memory_id)\\\n      .collection(\"photos\").document(photo_id).set({\n        \"url\": url,\n        \"caption\": caption,\n        \"date\": date,\n        \"era\": era,\n        \"embedding\": None,\n    })\n\ndef update_photo_embedding(memory_id: str, photo_id: str, embedding: list[float]) -> None:\n    db.collection(\"memories\").document(memory_id)\\\n      .collection(\"photos\").document(photo_id)\\\n      .update({\"embedding\": embedding})\n\ndef mark_memory_ready(memory_id: str, voice_id: str) -> None:\n    db.collection(\"memories\").document(memory_id).update({\n        \"status\": \"ready\",\n        \"voice_id\": voice_id,\n        \"embedding_ready\": True,\n    })\n```\n\n### Storage Upload (backend)\n```python\nimport uuid\nfrom werkzeug.datastructures import FileStorage\n\ndef upload_to_storage(file: FileStorage, memory_id: str, filename: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Upload file to Firebase Storage, return public URL.\"\"\"\n    blob = bucket.blob(f\"memories/{memory_id}/{filename}\")\n    blob.upload_from_file(file.stream, content_type=file.content_type)\n    blob.make_public()\n    return blob.public_url\n```\n\n### Firestore Read (for API responses)\n```python\ndef get_memory(memory_id: str) -> dict | None:\n    doc = db.collection(\"memories\").document(memory_id).get()\n    if not doc.exists:\n        return None\n\n    photos = db.collection(\"memories\").document(memory_id)\\\n               .collection(\"photos\").stream()\n\n    return {\n        \"id\": memory_id,\n        **doc.to_dict(),\n        \"photos\": [{\"id\": p.id, **p.to_dict()} for p in photos],\n    }\n```\n\n## Era Classification\n```python\ndef classify_era(date_str: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Classify photo into memory era based on year.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        year = int(date_str[:4])\n    except (ValueError, IndexError):\n        return \"recent\"\n\n    if year < 1970:\n        return \"childhood\"\n    elif year < 1990:\n        return \"young-adult\"\n    elif year < 2010:\n        return \"family\"\n    else:\n        return \"recent\"\n```\n\n## Key Rules\n- Unsubscribe Firestore listeners in useEffect cleanup — memory leak otherwise\n- Firebase Storage URLs: use getDownloadURL() not blob.public_url on frontend\n- Firestore: use batch writes when saving multiple documents atomically\n- Never use Firestore in lock-down mode during hackathon — use test mode\n- Backend Admin SDK init: always check `if not firebase_admin._apps` first\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"1158a938-a3b8-47c4-ac39-b4855048be25"}

right agent:\n\n| Situation | Invoke |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Starting a new phase | `mb-orchestrator` |\n| Building React components | `mb-frontend` |\n| Working on 3D spatial room | `mb-spatial` |\n| ElevenLabs / voice work | `mb-voice` |\n| Flask API / Firebase backend | `mb-backend` |\n| AMD embeddings / semantic graph | `mb-compute` |\n| Code review before advancing phase | `mb-reviewer` |\n| Got an error / something broke | `mb-debugger` |\n| Running integration tests | `mb-tester` |\n| Deploy / GitHub / ENV setup | `mb-devops` |\n| Loading states / animations | `mb-polisher` |\n| Devpost / demo prep | `mb-demo` |\n\n---\n\n## FALLBACK DECISION POINTS\n\n```\nHour 0: AMD not approved?\n  → mb-compute switches to local CPU sentence-transformers\n  → Note in Devpost: \"AMD in production — demo uses CPU fallback\"\n  → Still wins AMD prize if framing is right\n\nHour 0: No Mac with Apple Silicon?\n  → mb-spatial builds FallbackRoom (CSS 3D, full feature parity)\n  → Demo from browser instead of Vision Pro\n  → Still viable for WebSpatial prize (web spatial mode)\n\nHour 4: Voice clone sounds robotic?\n  → mb-voice re-records with 90-120s WAV in quiet room\n  → If still fails: use ElevenLabs \"Aria\" voice with warm persona\n  → Demo continues — conversational Q&A still impressive\n\nHour 12: ElevenLabs credits running low?\n  → mb-voice pre-records 5 \"demo responses\" as MP3 files\n  → Spatial room: hardcoded responses play for specific photos\n  → Live Q&A: 1 real call per judging session\n\nHour 18: Something fundamentally broken?\n  → mb-orchestrator: activate fallback tier\n  → Minimum viable: ElevenLabs agent + photo upload + voice Q&A\n  → Still wins: Best Freshman Hack + Best ElevenLabs ($2,980+)\n```\n\n---\n\n## PRIZE TARGETING CHECKLIST\n\nBefore final submission, verify each prize:\n\n**Best Freshman Hack ($1,000)**\n```\n[ ] All team members confirm graduation year 2029 in Devpost\n[ ] Product is functional (not

right agent:\n\n| Situation | Invoke |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Starting a new phase | `mb-orchestrator` |\n| Building React components | `mb-frontend` |\n| Working on 3D spatial room | `mb-spatial` |\n| ElevenLabs / voice work | `mb-voice` |\n| Flask API / Firebase backend | `mb-backend` |\n| AMD embeddings / semantic graph | `mb-compute` |\n| Code review before advancing phase | `mb-reviewer` |\n| Got an error / something broke | `mb-debugger` |\n| Running integration tests | `mb-tester` |\n| Deploy / GitHub / ENV setup | `mb-devops` |\n| Loading states / animations | `mb-polisher` |\n| Devpost / demo prep | `mb-demo` |\n\n---\n\n## FALLBACK DECISION POINTS\n\n```\nHour 0: AMD not approved?\n  → mb-compute switches to local CPU sentence-transformers\n  → Note in Devpost: \"AMD in production — demo uses CPU fallback\"\n  → Still wins AMD prize if framing is right\n\nHour 0: No Mac with Apple Silicon?\n  → mb-spatial builds FallbackRoom (CSS 3D, full feature parity)\n  → Demo from browser instead of Vision Pro\n  → Still viable for WebSpatial prize (web spatial mode)\n\nHour 4: Voice clone sounds robotic?\n  → mb-voice re-records with 90-120s WAV in quiet room\n  → If still fails: use ElevenLabs \"Aria\" voice with warm persona\n  → Demo continues — conversational Q&A still impressive\n\nHour 12: ElevenLabs credits running low?\n  → mb-voice pre-records 5 \"demo responses\" as MP3 files\n  → Spatial room: hardcoded responses play for specific photos\n  → Live Q&A: 1 real call per judging session\n\nHour 18: Something fundamentally broken?\n  → mb-orchestrator: activate fallback tier\n  → Minimum viable: ElevenLabs agent + photo upload + voice Q&A\n  → Still wins: Best Freshman Hack + Best ElevenLabs ($2,980+)\n```\n\n---\n\n## PRIZE TARGETING CHECKLIST\n\nBefore final submission, verify each prize:\n\n**Best Freshman Hack ($1,000)**\n```\n[ ] All team members confirm graduation year 2029 in Devpost\n[ ] Product is functional (not
